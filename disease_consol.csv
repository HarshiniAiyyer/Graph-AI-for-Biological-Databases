H00030,D02168,Cervical cancer,"Cervical cancer is the second largest cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide, and it occurs following persistent infection, sometimes for decades, with a specific subset of human papillomavirus (HPV) types, particularly types 16, 18, 33 and 42. Experimental studies show that the E6 and E7 genes of these high risk HPVs are oncogenes that deregulate key cell cycle controls. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins bind respectively to the p53 and Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins, which are involved in the regulation of growth control. The abnormalities in other cellular genes found in cervical cancer, including mutations in ras family of genes, and amplification in EGFR and ERBB2, may also play an important role in carcinogenesis and the aggressiveness of cervical tumors, although to date the role of most of these genetic abnormalities does not appear to be as important as the role of HPV.",Cancer,Topotecan hydrochloride
H01633,D10267,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide. Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives. Blood pressure is a heritable trait; an estimated 30% of variance in blood pressure relates to genetic factors. Understanding of the genetic architecture of traits has progressed in rare mendelian hypertensive phenotypes, such as Gordon's syndrome.",Cardiovascular disease,Methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide
H01358,D00107,Atopic dermatitis,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relapsing chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczematous skin lesions and intense pruritus. A genetic defect in the filaggrin (FLG) protein and/or environmental factors are thought to cause AD by disrupting the epidermis. This disruption, in turn, results in contact between immune cells in the dermis and antigens from the external environment leading to intense itching, scratching, and inflammation. Apart from FLG, recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many susceptibility loci of atopic dermatitis with genome-wide significance.",Immune system disease,Tacrolimus
H00010,D00754,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression.",Cancer,Thalidomide
H00612,D00655,Primary open angle glaucoma,"Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most prevalent form of glaucoma, and a major cause of irreversible blindness. POAG is often accompanied by ocular hypertension and characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, atrophy of the optic nerve, and visual field loss. To date, at least 20 genetic loci for POAG have been reported. And four causative genes (CYP1B1, MYOC, OPTN, and WDR36) are identified from these loci. In addition, recently, heterozygous NTF4 mutation was associated with the phenotype in a small percentage of patients.",Nervous system disease,Methazolamide
H00630,D00973,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA.",Autoimmune disease,Cortisone acetate
H01507,D00973,Seronegative arthritis,"Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA) represent a group of chronic articular inflammatory diseases which differ from rheumatoid arthritis for the typical absence of rheumatoid factor in serum, and have in common several epidemiological, pathological, clinical, and radiological features. SpA include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), reactive arthritis (ReA), enteropathic (IBD) associated arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), as well as undifferentiated, and juvenile SpA. The main clinical manifestations include inflammatory back pain, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and extra-skeletal manifestations, such as uveitis. Although the cause of SpA is unknown, it is generally accepted that SpA is a multifactorial disease. Genetics (such as HLA-B27), inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF), and more recently the IL-23/IL-17 cytokine pathway have links to pathogenesis. Biologic agents, particularly TNF blockers, are primary treatment options and have been shown to reduce symptomatic inflammation.",Musculoskeletal disease,Cortisone acetate
H01424,D00276,Group A streptococcal pharyngitis,"Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is an acute infection of the oropharynx and/or nasopharynx that is caused by group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). Group A streptococcus is responsible for 5-15% of cases of pharyngitis in adults and 20-30% of cases in children, and is the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis. The disorder is primarily a disease of children between 5 and 15 years of age, and, in temperate climates, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring. The onset of symptoms in patients is often abrupt. In addition to throat pain, symptoms may include fever, chills, malaise, headache, and particularly in younger children abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis are not typical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis, and, if present, they suggest an alternative cause such as a viral infection. In most persons, fever resolves within 3-5 days, and throat pain resolves within 1 week, even without specific treatment. Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of subsequent development of acute rheumatic fever and suppurative complications.",Infectious disease,Clarithromycin
H01709,D00942,Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis,"Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is a common and severe adverse event. Glucocorticoid use is one of the most important causes of osteonecrosis. In patients receiving long-term therapy, glucocorticoids induce fractures in 30 to 50% and osteonecrosis in 9 to 40%. The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor. Bisphosphonates are first-line options for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and may also be useful in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis. It has been indicated that bisphosphonates may rapidly reduce pain, and delay joint collapse in patients with osteonecrosis.",Musculoskeletal disease,Risedronate sodium
H00412,D10605,Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family of dsDNA-RT viruses. Both acute and chronic hepatitis B can be caused by blood-borne HBV infections. The risk of developing chronic hepatitis B is directly related to the age of first infection, much higher for infants. Chronic hepatitis B may eventaully lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",Infectious disease,Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate
H01637,D01915,Hypertriglyceridemia,"Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a condition with fasting triglyceride (TG) levels in blood continuing to rise. HTG generally refers to an increase of plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations above the 95th percentile for age and gender of a reference population. HTG has generally been classified as primary when a definite familial or inherited basis is suspected, whereas secondary HTG refers to cases where there coexist one or more identifiable secondary conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), alcohol consumption, various medications, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, etc. Genetic conditions with HTG include familial HTG (FHTG), familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) [DS:H00153], and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) [DS:H00156]. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of HTG, fibrates, niacin and n-3 fatty acids. Each of these classes has limitations. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.",Metabolic disease,Rosuvastatin calcium
H00342,D00346,Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by strains of mycobacteria, mainly Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resulting in an estimated two million deaths each year worldwide, more than from any other single bacterial pathogen. Inhalation is the predominant pathway of infection, making pulmonary tuberculosis the most common form of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis may arise either from a recent infection with M. tuberculosis, or from the reactivation of dormant bacilli, years or decades after initial infection. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis mainly results from reactivation of a tuberculous focus after hematogenous dissemination or lymphogenous spread from a primary, usually pulmonary focus.",Infectious disease,Isoniazid
H00368,D04301,Cytomegalovirus infection,Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus of the Herpesviridae family acquired by late childhood in the majority of individuals. Primary infection is nonspecific but after that the virus becomes latent in multiple organs and can later be reactivated. CMV is an important and common cause of mortality and morbidity in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy.,Infectious disease,Ganciclovir sodium
H00057,D00253,Parkinson disease,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Carbidopa hydrate and levodopa
H01459,D03065,Diabetic neuropathy,"Diabetic neuropathies (DNs) are nerve damaging disorders caused by diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy broadly comprise generalized symmetric polyneuropathies (acute sensory, chronic sensorimotor, autonomic) and asymmetric (focal and multifocal) neuropathies (cranial, truncal, focal-limb, proximal-motor, coexisting chronic inflammatory demyelinating), which affect all organs and system. Of all types, diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN), also called distal symmetric neuropathy, is the most typical form. Typical Symptoms vary from person to person, but may include numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness that typically starts in the feet and progresses up the legs. This pattern of neuropathy shows a progressive distal axonopathy. It has been reported that vascular endothelial growth factor A is associated with DNs development and progression.",Endocrine and metabolic disease; Nervous system disease,Becaplermin
H00014,D10450,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Alectinib hydrochloride
H01609,D11022,Insomnia,"Insomnia is a common disorder with a prevalence of about 10% in the general population. The most common complaints related to insomnia are difficulty initiating sleep (sleep-onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep due to prolonged nocturnal awakenings (sleep-maintenance insomnia), early morning awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from lack of sleep. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression, suicidality, and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line therapy. While behavioral therapies are effective for chronic insomnia in some patients, pharmacotherapy is frequently used when immediate short-term symptom relief is needed. The most effective pharmacologic therapies for insomnia are benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants.",Nervous system disease,Lemborexant
H01714,D05429,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Aminophylline hydrate

H00031,D02115,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Methotrexate sodium
H00237,D00979,Diamond-Blackfan anemia,"Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous congenital erythroid aplasia that develops within the first year of life.

H00149,D10813,Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a group of severe neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases characterized by intracellular accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin in neurons. NCLs share similar symptoms and signs such as retinopathy, epilepsy, and dementia. Historically, the NCLs were classified by age of disease onset as congenital NCL, infantile NCL (INCL), late infantile NCL (LINCL), juvenile NCL (JNCL) or adult NCL (ANCL). The presently used nomenclature is based on the genetic findings and divides the NCLs into thirteen forms, CLN1-CLN13.",Congenital disorder of metabolism,Cerliponase alfa
H01639,D00951,Endometriosis,"Endometriosis is defined as the growth of the endometrial glands and stroma at extra-uterine sites, which are most commonly implanted over and under visceral and peritoneal surfaces within the female pelvis but which can also be found in the connective tissue in the pelvis areas and, more rarely, in any anatomic district. It is a major cause of infertility, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain, mediated by marked pelvic inflammation. While retrograde menstruation is the most widely accepted cause, its pathogenesis and natural course are not fully understood. Endometriosis is known to be a estrogen-dependent disease, manifests during reproductive years.",Reproductive system disease,Medroxyprogesterone acetate
H01645,D00401,Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a pathological disorder characterised by increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland. The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission. In patients with toxic nodular goiter, ATDs are generally used to restore euthyroidism before definitive treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, and infrequently used as long-term treatment when the other two therapies are contraindicated or the patient has a short life expectancy.",Endocrine disease,Methimazole

H00024,D11040,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Apalutamide

H00007,D00363,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Lomustine
H01132,D03978,Aplastic anemia,"Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare disease in which the reduction of the circulating blood cells results from damage to the stem cell pool in bone marrow. Most cases of acquired aplastic anemia are the consequence of an immune-mediated destruction of hematopoiesis. Autoreactive cytotoxic T cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of AA by myelosuppressive cytokines including interferon-gamma. It has been reported that polymorphisms in IFNG are related to AA. A minority of patients with AA has heterozygous mutations in genes encoding the telomerase components TERT or TERC.

H01563,D06677,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Elvitegravir

H01646,D00563,Major depressive disorder,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric disorder mainly characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, and a high risk of suicide. Accumulated evidence suggests that both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the etiology of MDD although the pathogenesis of MDD remains unknown. Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Recently, selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs,) have become the first-line antidepressant drug treatment of depression and replaced tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to fewer side-effects and ease of use.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Mirtazapine
H01176,D00240,Uncomplicated urinary tract infection,"Staphylococci are widespread as commensals of humans and animals where they colonize the skin or mucous membranes. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, gram-positive uropathogen and frequently isolated from young female outpatients presenting with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

H00031,D11068,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Letrozole and ribociclib
H01714,D10501,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol trifenatate
H01490,D06886,Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy. Currently, 13 different drugs with ten different active components are licensed in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for the treatment of MS.",Nervous system disease,Natalizumab

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis.

Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome.

H00038,D02745,Melanoma,"Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE.

The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor. Bisphosphonates are first-line options for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and may also be useful in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis.

PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects.

RPCA can be classified into congenital and acquired. Congenital PRCA is also known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia [DS:H00237] and is a disease of infancy and early childhood. The aetiology of acquired PRCA can be subclassified into primary and secondary. Primary PRCA is defined when no aetiology can be identified using available investigations. The causes of secondary PRCA are again diverse and can be due to infections (viral, bacterial, etc.), drugs (erythropoietin, carbamazepine, etc.), collagen vascular disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.), malignancies (e.g. thymoma), ABO-incompatible haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pregnancy. Depending on the cause, the course can be acute and self-limiting or chronic with rare spontaneous remissions. PRCA can be easily diagnosed when isolated anaemia, in the presence of normal white cell and platelet counts, is associated with a marrow of normal cellularity in which there is an almost complete absence of erythroblasts but normal myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. Primary, or secondary PRCA not responding to treatment of the underlying diseases, is treated as an immunologically-mediated disease.

Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

H00024,D10398,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Radium Ra 223 dichloride
H00004,D05870,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy.

H00083,D00583,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Thiotepa

H01635,D10557,Hyperlipidemia,"Dyslipidemia is a condition characterized by either an increase or decrease in concentration of lipids in the blood. Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and combined hyperlipidemia refer to elevations involving the major cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (LDL), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL), and both, respectively.",Metabolic disease,Evolocumab

H00003,D01633,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as PML-RARalpha (in Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML), AML-ETO or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",Cancer,Enocitabine
H01649,D10309,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Brexpiprazole

H01331,D05919,Dental caries,"Dental caries occurs due to demineralization of enamel and dentine (the hard tissues of the teeth) by organic acids formed by bacteria in dental plaque through the anaerobic metabolism of sugars derived from the diet. The 2 primary bacteria involved in caries formation are mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. When sugars or other fermentable carbohydrates are ingested, the resulting fall in dental plaque pH caused by organic acids increases the solubility of calcium hydroxyapatite in the dental hard tissues and demineralization occurs as calcium is lost from the tooth surface. The pH at which demineralization occurs is often referred to as the critical pH and is approximately 5.5.",Infectious disease,Stannous fluoride
H01463,D09587,Mycosis fungoides,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common type of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), which are a heterogeneous group of malignancies derived from skin-homing T cells. MF presents in the skin with erythematous patches, plaques, and less frequently, tumours. Although the aetiologies of MF are unknown, important insights have been gained in the immunological and genetic perturbations that are associated with these diseases. Mutations in the p53, p15, p16, JunB, and PTEN genes generally occur in later-stage disease. Loss of normal apoptotic T-cell pathways has also been reported. Apoptosis is partly mediated by death receptors, notably Fas, which is part of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. Decreased and/or defective Fas expression by neoplastic T cells has been associated with advanced/aggressive disease and impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis.",Cancer,Brentuximab vedotin
H00079,D00983,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Triamcinolone acetonide
H01614,D01277,Multiple system atrophy,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an intractable neurodegenerative disease characterized by autonomic failure in addition to various combinations of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal dysfunction. MSA encompasses striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and Shy-Drager syndrome, which were originally described as independent clinicopathological entities. The coexistence was detected later, and these conditions were regarded as nosologically allied. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein fibrils in oligodendrocytes that form glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI), a neuropathological hallmark and central player in the pathogenesis of MSA. Although MSA is widely considered to be a nongenetic disorder, genetic mutations of the COQ2 gene have been linked to MSA as identified in Japanese families.",Neurodegenerative disease,Droxidopa

H01703,D00823,Eating Disorders,"Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), are disorders defined by disturbances in eating behavior. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors. In addition, an association between the BDNF gene polymorphism and eating disorders has been demonstrated. Other genetic risk factors for eating disorders has also been reported.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Fluoxetine hydrochloride
H01594,D03940,Myasthenia gravis,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a defective transmission of nerve impulses to muscles leading to muscle weakness and fatigability. Some, but not all, muscles are affected and not necessarily symmetrically. Increased weakness with continued muscle activity represents a diagnostic clue for MG, but these clinical features can vary. MG is B-cell mediated, and is associated with antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Patients should be classified into subgroups to help with therapeutic decisions and prognosis. Subgroups based on serum antibodies and clinical features include early-onset, late-onset, thymoma, MUSK, LRP4, antibody-negative, and ocular forms of myasthenia gravis. Agrin-associated MG might emerge as a new entity. The prognosis is good with optimum symptomatic, immunosuppressive, and supportive treatment. The evolution of MG is unpredictable, but it is generally characterized by the occurrence of relapses, sometimes subsequent to remissions and a worsening trend. For 85% of MG patients, the maximum severity is reached within less than 3 years.",Immune system disease; Nervous system disease,Eculizumab
H02421,D10574,Solid tumor,"Cancers can be classified into two broad types: hematological or solid tumors. There are two main types of solid tumors: carcinomas and sarcomas. Most solid tumors are derived from epithelial cells. Carcinomas are tumors that form in epithelial cells. Neoplastic epithelial cells generate aggressive cancers such as those located in the lung, breast, colon, prostate and ovary. Some cancers of the bladder ureters and kidneys are transitional cell carcinomas. Sarcomas are tumors that start in tissues like a blood vessel, bone, fat tissue, ligament, lymph vessel, muscle or tendon.

H02398,D11472,COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory infection that is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial cells [mainly alveolar epithelial type 2 (AEC2) cells] through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Upon the occupancy of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2, the increased serum level of free Angiotensin II (Ang II) due to a reduction of ACE2-mediated degradation promotes activation of the NF-kappa B pathway via Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), followed by  interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. SARS-CoV-2 also activates the innate immune system; macrophage stimulation triggers the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, and the 'cytokine storm', which results in systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. The combined effects of complement activation, dysregulated neutrophilia, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability appear to be intertwined to drive the severe features of COVID-19.",Infectious disease,Remdesivir

H00010,D08971,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

With regard to the current WHO classification, leukemic, cutaneous, nodal, and extranodal PTCL are distinguished. The most common subtypes worldwide are the nodal T cell lymphomas. In the nodal T cell lymphomas, the major subtypes are PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and ALK-negative ALCL. Novel approaches are gradually clarifying the molecular pathogenesis of PTCLs. ALK gene translocation and dual specificity phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) gene translocation are seen in ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL, respectively. Recently, gene mutations in epigenetic regulators, including Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 (TET2), DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 /2 (IDH1/2), are discovered in hematologic malignancies.

H01694,D00146,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes. There is still no consensus on a definite treatment method for SJS-TEN.

H01490,D11072,Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy. Currently, 13 different drugs with ten different active components are licensed in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for the treatment of MS.",Nervous system disease,Siponimod fumarate

PS include idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and vascular Parkinsonism (VaP), among other rarer causes of parkinsonism. Point mutations, duplications and triplications in the alpha-synuclein gene cause a rare dominant form of PS in families. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been identified as a much more common cause for dominant PS, especially in certain ethnic groups, while mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.",Neurodegenerative disease,Diphenhydramine hydrochloride

H00022,D10773,Bladder cancer,"The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).",Cancer,Atezolizumab
H01595,D00985,Cutaneous lupus erythematosus,"Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is the skin-related form of lupus erythematosus (LE), with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and a variable course. CLE is a frequent finding in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can also exist as a single entity without associated systemic autoimmunity (LE-specific skin disease). Despite ongoing research into the cause of CLE, it remains unclear how CLE relates to SLE pathogenesis. LE-specific skin disease includes the subtypes of CLE such as acute cutaneous LE (ACLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE), and intermittent CLE (ICLE). ACLE is characterized by malar rash or maculopapular eruption on sun exposed areas. SCLE characteristically presents as annular or psoriasiform plaques in a photo distribution. CCLE can be further divided into discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), LE profundus (LEP), chilblain LE (CLE), and LE tumidus (LET). The pathogenesis of CLE is multifactorial and involves genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and abnormalities in the immune response. It has been reported that many genetic risk factors for CLE involve HLA or interferon-related pathways. Corticosteroids and antimalarials were considered as the most suitable and effective systemic drugs for CLE patients.",Immune system disease; Skin disease,Triamcinolone hexacetonide

It usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. Typical symptoms include episodic burning epigastric pain, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy. About 25 percent of patients with peptic ulcer have a serious complication such as hemorrhage, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction.

H01695,D00751,Erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects. To date, their use has been limited to EM major, as EM minor is self-limited.",Skin and connective tissue disease,Methylprednisolone sodium succinate
H01586,D00292,Acquired pure red cell aplasia,"Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare condition characterised by selective inhibition and the absence of red cell precursors in the bone marrow with consequent anaemia and reticulocytopenia in the presence of normal granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages. RPCA can be classified into congenital and acquired. Congenital PRCA is also known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia [DS:H00237] and is a disease of infancy and early childhood. The aetiology of acquired PRCA can be subclassified into primary and secondary. Primary PRCA is defined when no aetiology can be identified using available investigations. The causes of secondary PRCA are again diverse and can be due to infections (viral, bacterial, etc.), drugs (erythropoietin, carbamazepine, etc.), collagen vascular disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.), malignancies (e.g. thymoma), ABO-incompatible haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pregnancy. Depending on the cause, the course can be acute and self-limiting or chronic with rare spontaneous remissions. PRCA can be easily diagnosed when isolated anaemia, in the presence of normal white cell and platelet counts, is associated with a marrow of normal cellularity in which there is an almost complete absence of erythroblasts but normal myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. Primary, or secondary PRCA not responding to treatment of the underlying diseases, is treated as an immunologically-mediated disease. The therapeutic plan usually focuses on the sequential use of various immunosuppressive therapies until a remission is obtained.",Hematologic disease; Immune system disease,Dexamethasone
H01563,D06478,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Darunavir ethanolate
H01717,D00088,Optic neuritis,"Optic neuritis is a demyelinating inflammatory disease of the optic nerve that presents with an abrupt loss of vision. The majority of patients are between the ages of 20 and 50 years, with a mean age ranging from 30 to 35 years. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. The onset is usually with pain on eye movement in one eye and subacute visual loss. One-third of patients have a mildly edematous optic disc. The visual disturbance resolves in 95% of cases. Many cases of optic neuritis are associated with multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica or can occur in isolation. Occasionally, optic neuritis can result from infectious processes involving the paranasal sinuses or occur in the course of a systemic viral infection. High-dosed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy speeds recovery but does not improve the final outcome. For patients judged to be at high risk of developing multiple sclerosis, immune prophylaxis with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate is recommended.",Nervous system disease,Hydrocortisone
H00014,D11108,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Cemiplimab

It is characterized by a retinal thickening in the macular area due to the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Extracellular fluid accumulates in the intraretinal area or collects in the subretinal space. In more severe cases, it occurs as cystoid edema with the typical petaloid appearance, and is the leading cause of visual loss. New treatments for macular edema have emerged over the past decade, the most recent and efficacious of which have involved blockage of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by frequent intravitreal injection of pharmacologic agents.",Nervous system disease,Dexamethasone
H00079,D00324,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Flunisolide
H01656,D00407,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Methylprednisolone

Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.

H01649,D05340,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Paliperidone palmitate

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H00056,D04905,Alzheimer disease,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD.

H00057,D00785,Parkinson disease,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Selegiline hydrochloride
H00056,D02558,Alzheimer disease,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD.

This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

H01656,D09214,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Ustekinumab

The pain of CH is associated with ipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, ptosis and/or eyelid edema, and/or restlessness or agitation. Headaches often recur at the same time each day during the cluster period, which can last for weeks to months. CH occurs more commonly in male patients (2.5:1 to 4.3:1 male to female) with an average age of onset in the third or fourth decade. The pathophysiology of CH is not fully understood, but may include a genetic component. Treatment focuses on avoiding triggers and includes abortive therapies, prophylaxis during the cluster period, and long-term treatment in patients with chronic CH. Evidence supports the use of supplemental oxygen, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan for acute treatment of episodic CH. Verapamil is used to treat chronic CH.

H01604,D00979,Polymyositis and dermatomyositis,"Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.",Musculoskeletal disease,Methylprednisolone acetate

Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3.

SS may occur as a primary disorder or in association with other systemic autoimmune diseases, traditionally defined as secondary SS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Salivary secretions from these patients exhibit elevated levels of antibodies and cytokines. This is accompanied by a reduction in oral phosphate levels and xerostomia due to reduced salivary flow, which can lead to infections, progressive caries, dysphagia and oral pain. Current tests for SS include sialometry, salivary scintigraphy, sialography, serological tests or minor salivary gland biopsies. Recently, salivary biomarkers of SS has been investigated. The etiology of SS is still unclear. Since there is a familial aggregation of primary SS, however, genetic factors have been suspected for a long time. Initially, HLA haplotypes were shown to be associated with primary SS.

H01653,D00458,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Quetiapine fumarate

H01490,D00088,Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy.

The disorder is primarily a disease of children between 5 and 15 years of age, and, in temperate climates, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring. The onset of symptoms in patients is often abrupt. In addition to throat pain, symptoms may include fever, chills, malaise, headache, and particularly in younger children abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis are not typical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis, and, if present, they suggest an alternative cause such as a viral infection.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

H01648,D00975,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27.

H01649,D00793,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Fluphenazine decanoate
H00021,D02714,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.",Cancer,Everolimus
H01633,D11388,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects.",Cancer,Interferon alfa-2b

H01653,D00454,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Olanzapine

The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation.

AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

H01656,D10438,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Guselkumab

H00079,D08985,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Reslizumab

These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Entacapone

H00014,D11713,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Selpercatinib

The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

CAD is coupled to a pathogenic process in which lipids and lipoproteins accumulate in the subendothelial intimal layer of the vessel wall. A variety of environmental and genetic risk factors are associated with CAD, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and a family history of early CAD. It has been reported that an autosomal dominant form of CAD is caused by the mutation in transcription factor MEF2A.

H01585,D00751,Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a relatively uncommon disorder caused by the increased destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) by anti-RBC autoantibodies with or without complement activation. AIHAs can be distinguished on the basis of the autoantibody Ig class and thermal characteristics, i.e. the optimal temperature of reaction with autologous erythrocytes, in warm (wAIHA), cold (cold agglutinin disease; CAD), and mixed forms, although atypical cases of difficult diagnostic classification are reported with increasing frequency. Moreover, AIHAs are classified in primary (idiopathic), in which hemolysis dominates the clinical picture in the absence of any other coexisting disorder, and in secondary forms, accompanying and complicating an underlying disease. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia. The diagnosis is usually simple, based on the presence of hemolytic anemia and serological evidence of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, detectable by the direct antiglobulin test (DAT).",Hematologic disease; Immune system disease,Methylprednisolone sodium succinate

H01532,D00970,Gout,"Gout is a kind of arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. It is triggered due to precipitation and deposition of inflammatory monosodium urate crystals in synovial and other tissues, accompanied by severe pain. The most common symptom include swelling, tenderness, warmth and redness. Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease. Epidemiology studies reported that the excessive intake of alcohol and purine rich food, which excessively produce uric acid, leads to accumulation of uric acid.",Musculoskeletal disease,Naproxen sodium
H01431,D10566,Cushing syndrome,"Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare disorder resulting from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids via exogenous and endogenous sources. The typical clinical features of CS are related to hypercortisolism and include accumulation of central fat, moon facies, neuromuscular weakness, osteoporosis or bone fractures, metabolic complications, and mood changes. Traditionally, endogenous CS is classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent (about 80%) or ACTH- independent (about 20%). Among ACTH-dependent forms, pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing's disease) is most common. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic, resulting from monoclonal expansion of a single mutated cell. Recently recurrent activating somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 gene (USP8) were identified in almost half of corticotroph adenoma. Germline mutations in MEN1 (encoding menin), AIP (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein), PRKAR1A (encoding cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit) and CDKN1B (encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; also known as p27 Kip1) have been identified in familial forms of pituitary adenomas. However, the frequency of familial pituitary adenomas is less than 5% in patients with pituitary adenomas. Among ACTH-independent CS, adrenal adenoma is most common. Rare adrenal causes of CS include primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) or primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD).",Endocrine and metabolic disease,Pasireotide pamoate

H00100,D03235,Neutropenic disorders,"Neutropenias represent a series of potentially life-threatening disorders characterised by a reduction in circulating neutrophils. Since neutrophils play a major role in host defense against bacteria, neutropenia patients suffer from frequent episodes of opportunistic bacterial infections. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare neutropenia with a bone marrow maturation arrest of granulocytic differentiation. Kostmann syndrome is an autosomal recessive SCN. The characteristic maturation arrest and the lack of mature neutrophils in peripheral blood of patients with Kostmann syndrome can be explained by the deletion of an anti-apoptotic factor (HAX-1) in myeloid cells of these patients. Heterozygous mutations in the protooncogene growth factor-independent 1 (GFI1) gene are also associated with SCN. In patients with autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia (CyN), a condition with oscillating neutrophil counts but less severe clinical symptoms, heterozygous mutations in ELA-2/ELANE were discovered. Patients with X-linked severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) have been reported with activating mutations in WASp leading to a constitutively-active form of the protein, and unregulated actin polymerization.",Primary immunodeficiency,Filgrastim

H01593,D02217,Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a generalised reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and an increased risk of fracture. Since BMD values fall progressively with age, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of all women will have osteoporosis by the age of 80. Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

'Angina' is used to describe clinical symptoms such as discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arms that are induced by physical exertion or emotional stress and subside with rest or treatment with nitroglycerin. Angina is clinically classified into stable angina (SA) and unstable angina (UA). SA is a chronic medical condition while UA is an acute coronary syndrome. Among the causes of angina pectoris, the most common is coronary artery disease (CAD).

The discovery of hypocretin-1 (HCRT) deficiency shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. The hypocretin neurotransmission system was shown to play a major role in controlling vigilance states. Because of the strong HLA association, hypocretin deficiency is believed to be caused by an autoimmune attack.

H01672,D00448,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome.

H01653,D00304,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Divalproex sodium

The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement (C5) leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a.

H00010,D01968,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression.",Cancer,Zoledronic acid
H01490,D04187,Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy. Currently, 13 different drugs with ten different active components are licensed in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for the treatment of MS.",Nervous system disease,Fingolimod hydrochloride
H00630,D00142,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA.",Autoimmune disease,Methotrexate

H00004,D06414,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.",Cancer,Dasatinib
H01563,D00891,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Abacavir sulfate
H01633,D00513,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

It can cause infections at many sites including superficial skin infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and breast abscess. Endocarditis caused by S. lugdunensis can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Secondly, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, found among the normal skin flora, is commonly isolated from the axillae, perineum, and inguinal areas of humans and causes septicemia, peritonitis, otitis, and urinary tract infections. S. haemolyticus is notorious for its multidrug resistance and historically early acquisition of resistance to methicillin and glycopeptide antibiotics. Finally, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is an important opportunistic pathogen of dogs and cats. S. pseudintermedius colonization is very uncommon in humans.

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

H00007,D00478,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Procarbazine hydrochloride
H00038,D10104,Melanoma,"Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

H00630,D00118,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear.

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years.

H00014,D10926,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

H01648,D00973,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Cortisone acetate

The E6 and E7 oncoproteins bind respectively to the p53 and Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins, which are involved in the regulation of growth control. The abnormalities in other cellular genes found in cervical cancer, including mutations in ras family of genes, and amplification in EGFR and ERBB2, may also play an important role in carcinogenesis and the aggressiveness of cervical tumors, although to date the role of most of these genetic abnormalities does not appear to be as important as the role of HPV.",Cancer,Bevacizumab

H01491,D11079,Neuromyelitis optica,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic's disease is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that selectively affects optic nerves and spinal cord. The etiology of NMO is unknown but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder triggered by an environmental factor, possibly an infection, in genetically susceptible individuals. The principal effector in NMO is the self-reactive, complement-activating anti-AQP4 antibody. AQP4 water channel is a component of the dystroglycan protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the blood-brain barrier. Anti-AQP4 antibody is sensitive and highly specific serum markers of autoimmune NMO. For many decades, NMO was considered to be a subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS), but prognosis and optimal treatments differ. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange (PLEX) are the most commonly used therapeutic modalities in acute settings. Corticosteroids exert global immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas PLEX removes antibodies, complement, and cytokines from the blood. Besides, immunosuppressant agents interfering with the function of T and B cells have been shown to prevent disease relapses and reduce neurological disability in NMO.",Immune system disease; Nervous system disease,Satralizumab
H00010,D08173,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes.

H00028,D02115,Choriocarcinoma,"Gestational choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant epithelial tumor that can be associated with any type of gestational event, most often a complete hydatidiform mole (CM). CM occur in about one per 1000 pregnancies, and about 5-20% of CM progress to invasive moles or choriocarcinoma. Several molecular studies have been done to establish the expression of tumor-associated proteins in choriocarcinoma. In the p53 pathway, overexpression of the p53 protein and the p53-associated protein, MDM2, have been detected. Synergistic upregulation of c-MYC, c-ERB-2, c-FMS, and BCL-2 oncoproteins have also been suggested to have an important role in the pathogenesis of choriocarcinoma.

H01656,D00742,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Etanercept

Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

Group A streptococcus is responsible for 5-15% of cases of pharyngitis in adults and 20-30% of cases in children, and is the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis. The disorder is primarily a disease of children between 5 and 15 years of age, and, in temperate climates, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring. The onset of symptoms in patients is often abrupt. In addition to throat pain, symptoms may include fever, chills, malaise, headache, and particularly in younger children abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis are not typical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis, and, if present, they suggest an alternative cause such as a viral infection. In most persons, fever resolves within 3-5 days, and throat pain resolves within 1 week, even without specific treatment.

H00079,D00751,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Methylprednisolone sodium succinate
H01563,D10708,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Fostemsavir tromethamine

Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.

H01604,D00981,Polymyositis and dermatomyositis,"Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.",Musculoskeletal disease,Prednisolone sodium phosphate

AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy.

The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) 'Philadelphia' chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners. If none of these specific genetic abnormalities are found, the designation of 'B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, not otherwise specified,' is appropriate.",Cancer,Mercaptopurine
H01463,D01068,Mycosis fungoides,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common type of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), which are a heterogeneous group of malignancies derived from skin-homing T cells. MF presents in the skin with erythematous patches, plaques, and less frequently, tumours. Although the aetiologies of MF are unknown, important insights have been gained in the immunological and genetic perturbations that are associated with these diseases. Mutations in the p53, p15, p16, JunB, and PTEN genes generally occur in later-stage disease. Loss of normal apoptotic T-cell pathways has also been reported. Apoptosis is partly mediated by death receptors, notably Fas, which is part of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. Decreased and/or defective Fas expression by neoplastic T cells has been associated with advanced/aggressive disease and impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis.",Cancer,Vinblastine sulfate
H01621,D07077,Pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Together, these observations support a prominent role for TGF-beta family members in the development of PAH.",Cardiovascular disease,Ambrisentan
H00082,D00562,Graves disease,"Graves disease is a common form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and is characterized by overstimulation of the thyroid gland with agonistic anti-thyrotropin (TSH) receptor autoantibodies. This overstimulation leads to follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, causing thyroid enlargement, as well as increases in thyroid hormone production and the fraction of triiodothyronine (T3) relative to thyroxine (T4) in thyroid secretion. Thyroid autoimmune diseases are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.",Immune system disease,Propylthiouracil
H01585,D00979,Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a relatively uncommon disorder caused by the increased destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) by anti-RBC autoantibodies with or without complement activation. AIHAs can be distinguished on the basis of the autoantibody Ig class and thermal characteristics, i.e. the optimal temperature of reaction with autologous erythrocytes, in warm (wAIHA), cold (cold agglutinin disease; CAD), and mixed forms, although atypical cases of difficult diagnostic classification are reported with increasing frequency. Moreover, AIHAs are classified in primary (idiopathic), in which hemolysis dominates the clinical picture in the absence of any other coexisting disorder, and in secondary forms, accompanying and complicating an underlying disease. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia. The diagnosis is usually simple, based on the presence of hemolytic anemia and serological evidence of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, detectable by the direct antiglobulin test (DAT).",Hematologic disease; Immune system disease,Methylprednisolone acetate
H01656,D00973,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Cortisone acetate

H01450,D00824,Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Fluvoxamine maleate

Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

H00031,D10574,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

H00021,D06272,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha.

H00243,D01203,Hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 4),"Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Type 4 RTA is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling. Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2. Acquired hyperkalemic RTA is observed in the context of mineralocorticoid deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, and AIDS nephropathy.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes.

It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Paliperidone
H01714,D05277,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Formoterol fumarate hydrate
H01621,D09994,Pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Together, these observations support a prominent role for TGF-beta family members in the development of PAH.",Cardiovascular disease,Selexipag
H01695,D00146,Erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects. To date, their use has been limited to EM major, as EM minor is self-limited.",Skin and connective tissue disease,Corticotropin
H00024,D00573,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Goserelin acetate

H01664,D00825,Panic disorder,"Panic disorder (PD) is a common type of anxiety disorder, characterized by unexpected and repeated panic attacks or fear of future panic attacks. It has a rapid onset and includes symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, sweating and shaking. Some physical illnesses (e.g. asthma) commonly occur with panic disorder, and certain lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking) increase the risk for the disorder, but causal pathways are still unclear. In recent years, an association was found between panic symptoms and increased activity in the right frontal region of the brain. Genetic susceptibility factors also exist, but their exact nature and pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and several medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and benzodiazepines are effective for PD. Among these, SSRIs and SNRIs are considered to be first-line treatment agents because of their efficacy and favorable side effect profile.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Sertraline hydrochloride

H00082,D00401,Graves disease,"Graves disease is a common form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and is characterized by overstimulation of the thyroid gland with agonistic anti-thyrotropin (TSH) receptor autoantibodies. This overstimulation leads to follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, causing thyroid enlargement, as well as increases in thyroid hormone production and the fraction of triiodothyronine (T3) relative to thyroxine (T4) in thyroid secretion. Thyroid autoimmune diseases are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.",Immune system disease,Methimazole

The most common complaints related to insomnia are difficulty initiating sleep (sleep-onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep due to prolonged nocturnal awakenings (sleep-maintenance insomnia), early morning awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from lack of sleep. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression, suicidality, and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line therapy. While behavioral therapies are effective for chronic insomnia in some patients, pharmacotherapy is frequently used when immediate short-term symptom relief is needed.

Persistent infection can cause inflammation and gastritis that may lead to carcinogenesis. Transmission is still not entirely clarified, but human-to-human spread through oral-oral or fecal-oral route is thought to be the most plausible. The prevalence of HP infection varies between different geographical regions; generally, the prevalence is about 30% in developed and up to 80% in developing countries.

Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H01672,D02597,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder.

H00100,D06889,Neutropenic disorders,"Neutropenias represent a series of potentially life-threatening disorders characterised by a reduction in circulating neutrophils. Since neutrophils play a major role in host defense against bacteria, neutropenia patients suffer from frequent episodes of opportunistic bacterial infections. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare neutropenia with a bone marrow maturation arrest of granulocytic differentiation. Kostmann syndrome is an autosomal recessive SCN. The characteristic maturation arrest and the lack of mature neutrophils in peripheral blood of patients with Kostmann syndrome can be explained by the deletion of an anti-apoptotic factor (HAX-1) in myeloid cells of these patients. Heterozygous mutations in the protooncogene growth factor-independent 1 (GFI1) gene are also associated with SCN. In patients with autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia (CyN), a condition with oscillating neutrophil counts but less severe clinical symptoms, heterozygous mutations in ELA-2/ELANE were discovered.

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Cyclosporine

Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways.

H00630,D02934,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression.",Cancer,Doxorubicin hydrochloride
H02434,D11990,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified","Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS) is the most common type of DLBCL. DLBCL accounts for 30-40% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), making it the most prevalent form of NHL. DLBCL can occur as primary disease or through histologic transformation from other low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. The cell-of-origin (COO) determination based on gene expression profiling (GEP) subdivides most DLBCL, NOS patients into two main categories, namely germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. GCB subtype is characterized by frequent mutations in involved histone methylation or acetylation (EZH2, EP300), B-cell homing (GNA13, GNAI2), PI3K pathway signalling (PTEN), and apoptotic pathway (BCL2). In contrast, ABC subtype is driven by frequent mutations in the B cell receptor and NFKB pathways (CARD11, CD79a/CD79b, TNFAIP3 and MYD88).",Cancer,Lisocabtagene maraleucel
H00031,D10773,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Atezolizumab
H01656,D10061,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Brodalumab
H01507,D00088,Seronegative arthritis,"Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA) represent a group of chronic articular inflammatory diseases which differ from rheumatoid arthritis for the typical absence of rheumatoid factor in serum, and have in common several epidemiological, pathological, clinical, and radiological features. SpA include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), reactive arthritis (ReA), enteropathic (IBD) associated arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), as well as undifferentiated, and juvenile SpA. The main clinical manifestations include inflammatory back pain, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and extra-skeletal manifestations, such as uveitis. Although the cause of SpA is unknown, it is generally accepted that SpA is a multifactorial disease. Genetics (such as HLA-B27), inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF), and more recently the IL-23/IL-17 cytokine pathway have links to pathogenesis.

H01653,D01164,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Aripiprazole
H01714,D11630,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Aminophylline dihydrate
H01563,D10835,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide

H01621,D09572,Pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Together, these observations support a prominent role for TGF-beta family members in the development of PAH.",Cardiovascular disease,Riociguat

HE most commonly occurs in decompensated liver cirrhosis and incorporates a spectrum of manifestations that ranges from mild cognitive impairment to coma. Although its pathogenesis is not entirely understood, one of the main factors is thought to be ammonia. Apart from hyperammonemia, various other pathogenic mechanisms, such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) theory, the benzodiazepine theory, the manganese theory, and the theory of oxidative/nitrosative stress, have been implicated in the development of HE.

Furthermore, insomnia is associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression, suicidality, and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line therapy. While behavioral therapies are effective for chronic insomnia in some patients, pharmacotherapy is frequently used when immediate short-term symptom relief is needed.

H01672,D00978,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.",Immune system disease,Hydrocortisone sodium succinate
H01648,D00751,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Methylprednisolone sodium succinate
H01635,D00049,Hyperlipidemia,"Dyslipidemia is a condition characterized by either an increase or decrease in concentration of lipids in the blood. Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and combined hyperlipidemia refer to elevations involving the major cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (LDL), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL), and both, respectively.",Metabolic disease,Niacin
H01626,D01748,Arteriosclerosis obliterans,"Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) is one of the most common peripheral vascular diseases that causes ischemic symptoms of the lower limbs. Symptoms include discomfort, numbness, intermittent claudication, or even gangrene and ulceration. The risk factors of ASO include age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and hyperhomocysteinemia. There are no definitive treatments for ASO. The efficacy of surgical treatment is not satisfactory, and medication is required to maintain the postoperative vascular patency. In order to relieve symptoms such as cold sensation and intermittent claudication, drug therapy such as antiplatelet therapy and vasodilatory drugs are useful in the treatment of some patients with ASO. Adsorption of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has also been applied for the treatment of ASO. At present, the diagnosis of ASO depends on several clinical tests, such as angiography, estimations of ankle/brachial index (ABI), and pulse-wave velocity (PWV), as well as the measurement of circulating hs-CRP levels. However, these examinations can only be detectable when ASO already developed, and there was no predictable markers for ASO in its earlier stages.

H01585,D00292,Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a relatively uncommon disorder caused by the increased destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) by anti-RBC autoantibodies with or without complement activation. AIHAs can be distinguished on the basis of the autoantibody Ig class and thermal characteristics, i.e. the optimal temperature of reaction with autologous erythrocytes, in warm (wAIHA), cold (cold agglutinin disease; CAD), and mixed forms, although atypical cases of difficult diagnostic classification are reported with increasing frequency. Moreover, AIHAs are classified in primary (idiopathic), in which hemolysis dominates the clinical picture in the absence of any other coexisting disorder, and in secondary forms, accompanying and complicating an underlying disease. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia. The diagnosis is usually simple, based on the presence of hemolytic anemia and serological evidence of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, detectable by the direct antiglobulin test (DAT).",Hematologic disease; Immune system disease,Dexamethasone
H01649,D06623,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Olanzapine pamoate
H00021,D05380,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha.

H01641,D04478,Dry eye desease,"Dry eye disease (also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca) is multifactorial disease of the tears, lids, and ocular surface which can result in symptoms of discomfort and/or visual disturbance and/or tear film instability with the potential for damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and subacute inflammation of the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common. Aqueous insufficiency is divided into two main groups: Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye and non-Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye (which includes the use of systemic medication). Dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) [DS:H01502] is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual's last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer's test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye. The benefit of long-term topical anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate or severe dry eye disease with corticosteroids or cyclosporine A eye drops has been documented in clinical trials on a high evidence level.

H02420,D07866,Head and neck cancer,"Head and neck cancers are a heterogeneous collection of malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract, salivary glands and thyroid. The most common type of cancer in the head and neck is squamous cell carcinoma. It mainly originates from the mucosal space, which extends from the skull base to the proximal esophagus. The head and neck region is subdivided in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx. The pharyngeal space contains the nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx and includes the tonsils, the floor of the mouth and the soft palate. Although head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is traditionally associated with smoking and alcohol drinking, a growing proportion of head and neck tumors, mainly of the oropharynx, are associated with human papilloma virus (HPV).",Cancer,Docetaxel
H00022,D00275,Bladder cancer,"The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).",Cancer,Cisplatin

H01672,D00118,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.",Immune system disease,Naproxen
H01633,D00362,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide. Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives. Blood pressure is a heritable trait; an estimated 30% of variance in blood pressure relates to genetic factors.

H00021,D06068,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.",Cancer,Temsirolimus
H01674,D00970,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression. The most frequently applied biological agents approved for AS are TNF alpha inhibitors.

It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Lumateperone tosylate

Firstly, Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a most unusual coagulase-negative staphylococcus found on the human skin. It can cause infections at many sites including superficial skin infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and breast abscess. Endocarditis caused by S. lugdunensis can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Secondly, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, found among the normal skin flora, is commonly isolated from the axillae, perineum, and inguinal areas of humans and causes septicemia, peritonitis, otitis, and urinary tract infections. S. haemolyticus is notorious for its multidrug resistance and historically early acquisition of resistance to methicillin and glycopeptide antibiotics. Finally, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is an important opportunistic pathogen of dogs and cats. S. pseudintermedius colonization is very uncommon in humans.

H01602,D03503,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which reflux of the stomach contents into the oesophagus results in symptoms or, occasionally, complications. GERD can be classified as non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or erosive reflux disease (ERD) based on the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal damage seen on endoscopy. ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Cimetidine hydrochloride
H01645,D00701,Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a pathological disorder characterised by increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland. The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission. In patients with toxic nodular goiter, ATDs are generally used to restore euthyroidism before definitive treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, and infrequently used as long-term treatment when the other two therapies are contraindicated or the patient has a short life expectancy.",Endocrine disease,Phenobarbital sodium

H00057,D04641,Parkinson disease,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Istradefylline

Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

H01669,D10677,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a chronic and progressive disorder characterized by elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and disturbances in mineral metabolism, mainly calcium and phosphorus. SHPT is generally caused by diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia in response to prolonged reduced levels of extracellular calcium from various secondary aetiologies. Although it is initially and adaptive response to a variety of stimuli resulting mainly in extracellular hypocalcaemia (vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, idiopathic hypercalciuria, calcium malabsorption), long-standing SHPT may eventually develop into autonomous HPT (ie, tertiary HPT). Because SHPT is a compensatory mechanism of the parathyroid glands, it commonly resolves with normalization of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. After excluding reversible secondary aetiologies, first-line treatment of irreversible SHPT (often related to chronic kidney disease) mainly involves medical therapies.",Endocrine disease,Etelcalcetide hydrochloride
H00031,D00966,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Tamoxifen citrate

Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy.

H01656,D00975,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Dexamethasone sodium phosphate

H00003,D01747,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as PML-RARalpha (in Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML), AML-ETO or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes.

Point mutations, duplications and triplications in the alpha-synuclein gene cause a rare dominant form of PS in families. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been identified as a much more common cause for dominant PS, especially in certain ethnic groups, while mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.",Neurodegenerative disease,Benztropine mesylate
H01714,D00685,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Metaproterenol sulfate
H00010,D03684,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

H00024,D10888,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Relugolix
H01642,D09998,Renal anemia,"Renal anemia is one of the most frequent complications of chronic kidney disease. Anemia leads to a decrease in oxygen delivery to vital organs, which is initially compensated for by tachycardia and cardiac hypertrophy, but eventually leads to the development of cardiovascular disease. Renal anemia is caused by the deficiency of endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) due to renal dysfunction. EPO is a glycoprotein hormone that has the role of the primary regulator of erythropoiesis. Formerly, treatment options were essentially limited to blood transfusions and androgen therapy, with its risks. However, since the late 1980s, the availability of recombinant human erythropoietin has revolutionized the management of renal anemia, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are now the mostly widely used drugs.",Urinary system disease,Epoetin beta pegol
H00630,D02596,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes.

H00014,D10018,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Necitumumab

H01633,D10591,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide. Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.",Immune system disease,Triamcinolone acetonide

H00010,D03150,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

It is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and abnormal bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation. In IBS, there appears to be no organic substance or biochemical abnormality that can explain the symptoms. IBS can be classified into categories: constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D), mixed IBS (IBS-M), and un-subtyped IBS. Anticholinergic drugs, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, high molecular weight polymers (polycarbophil calcium), gastrointestinal motility regulators, probiotics preparations, and laxatives are used in the treatment of IBS. However, they are not uniformly effective. Several studies of patients with IBS suggest that this disorder aggregates in families, and thus, appears potentially heritable.

H01658,D02994,Microscopic polyangiitis,"Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is an idiopathic autoimmune disease characterized by systemic vasculitis. MPA predominantly affects small-calibre blood vessels and is associated with the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). The association with ANCAs originally defined the group of ANCA-associated vasculitides, comprising granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) [DS:H01655], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) [DS:H01468], which have different frequencies of ANCA-positivity. ANCA in MPA are predominantly directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) but may, in a minority of patients, be directed against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). Not all patients, however, have ANCA. MPA is clinically characterized by small-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the kidneys and the lungs but other organs may be involved as well. Renal involvement, which can be the only manifestation, is clinically apparent as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and histopathologically as pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis is mainly established by clinical manifestations, computed tomography (TC), ANCA antibody detection, and renal and pulmonary biopsy. The introduction of aggressive immunosuppressive treatment has substantially improved the prognosis. The standardized therapeutic regimen is based on cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Using this regimen, remission can be achieved in most of the patients. Rituximab may represent an important alternative to cyclophosphamide for patients who may not respond adequately to antimetabolite therapies.",Nervous system disease; Cardiovascular disease; Immune system disease,Rituximab

Several molecular studies have been done to establish the expression of tumor-associated proteins in choriocarcinoma. In the p53 pathway, overexpression of the p53 protein and the p53-associated protein, MDM2, have been detected. Synergistic upregulation of c-MYC, c-ERB-2, c-FMS, and BCL-2 oncoproteins have also been suggested to have an important role in the pathogenesis of choriocarcinoma.

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Betamethasone dipropionate

H00038,D10176,Melanoma,"Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

H01602,D00673,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which reflux of the stomach contents into the oesophagus results in symptoms or, occasionally, complications. GERD can be classified as non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or erosive reflux disease (ERD) based on the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal damage seen on endoscopy. ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Ranitidine hydrochloride

The discovery of hypocretin-1 (HCRT) deficiency shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. The hypocretin neurotransmission system was shown to play a major role in controlling vigilance states. Because of the strong HLA association, hypocretin deficiency is believed to be caused by an autoimmune attack.

The onset is usually with pain on eye movement in one eye and subacute visual loss. One-third of patients have a mildly edematous optic disc. The visual disturbance resolves in 95% of cases. Many cases of optic neuritis are associated with multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica or can occur in isolation. Occasionally, optic neuritis can result from infectious processes involving the paranasal sinuses or occur in the course of a systemic viral infection.

H00021,D06402,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha.

H01450,D05375,Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Paroxetine mesylate

The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking.

H01593,D00942,Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a generalised reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and an increased risk of fracture. Since BMD values fall progressively with age, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of all women will have osteoporosis by the age of 80. Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

H00010,D10019,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

AIHAs can be distinguished on the basis of the autoantibody Ig class and thermal characteristics, i.e. the optimal temperature of reaction with autologous erythrocytes, in warm (wAIHA), cold (cold agglutinin disease; CAD), and mixed forms, although atypical cases of difficult diagnostic classification are reported with increasing frequency. Moreover, AIHAs are classified in primary (idiopathic), in which hemolysis dominates the clinical picture in the absence of any other coexisting disorder, and in secondary forms, accompanying and complicating an underlying disease. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia. The diagnosis is usually simple, based on the presence of hemolytic anemia and serological evidence of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, detectable by the direct antiglobulin test (DAT).",Hematologic disease; Immune system disease,Hydrocortisone sodium succinate
H01672,D00142,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.",Immune system disease,Methotrexate

It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis.

Most ZES cases are sporadic, but about over 20 percent are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (see H00247). The clinical presentation is not specific for this disease and there is overlap of symptoms similar to those of a peptic ulcer. The most common symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by heartburn, nausea, and weight loss. Peptic ulceration complicated by bleeding is present in 25% of patients, and is more frequently in patients with sporadic ZES than in those with MEN1. In addition, the gastrinomas may be cancerous.

H00014,D02165,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Calcipotriol hydrate

COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking.

H01717,D00973,Optic neuritis,"Optic neuritis is a demyelinating inflammatory disease of the optic nerve that presents with an abrupt loss of vision. The majority of patients are between the ages of 20 and 50 years, with a mean age ranging from 30 to 35 years. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. The onset is usually with pain on eye movement in one eye and subacute visual loss. One-third of patients have a mildly edematous optic disc. The visual disturbance resolves in 95% of cases. Many cases of optic neuritis are associated with multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica or can occur in isolation. Occasionally, optic neuritis can result from infectious processes involving the paranasal sinuses or occur in the course of a systemic viral infection.

It is now understood that ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma are the same disease entities at the morphologic and immunophenotypic levels and classified as either B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL and T-ALL). In the case of B-ALL, numerous reports have demonstrated that recurring genetic abnormalities are associated with sufficiently unique clinical, immunophenotypic, and/or prognostic features so that they can be considered as distinct entities. The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) 'Philadelphia' chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners.

H00038,D10615,Melanoma,"Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

Ovarian epithelial tumors are divided into mucinous, serous, endometrioid, and clear cell subtypes. Approximately 10% of ovarian cancers arise in women who have inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2).

H00031,D00327,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

H00007,D00254,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Carmustine
H00022,D00208,Bladder cancer,"The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).",Cancer,Mitomycin
H00020,D04197,Colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis.

It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear.

Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis.

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

H01653,D00801,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder.

H00845,D09673,Familial amyloidosis,"The amyloidoses are a group of diseases in which proteins that are normally soluble deposit extracellularly in tissues as insoluble fibrils. The fibrils have a characteristic beta-pleated sheet configuration that renders them avid for Congo red dye. In the familial amyloidoses, a gene mutation inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner results in a single amino acid substitution that renders a plasma protein amyloidogenic. Mutations in the TTR gene are the most common cause of familial amyloidosis. The clinical features of familial amyloidosis vary depending on the underlying amyloidogenic protein and the particular amino acid affected by the mutation, ranging from peripheral and autonomic neuropathy to cardiomyopathy.",Nervous system disease,Tafamidis
H00014,D10551,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Ceritinib

HTG generally refers to an increase of plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations above the 95th percentile for age and gender of a reference population. HTG has generally been classified as primary when a definite familial or inherited basis is suspected, whereas secondary HTG refers to cases where there coexist one or more identifiable secondary conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), alcohol consumption, various medications, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, etc. Genetic conditions with HTG include familial HTG (FHTG), familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) [DS:H00153], and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) [DS:H00156]. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of HTG, fibrates, niacin and n-3 fatty acids. Each of these classes has limitations. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.",Metabolic disease,Fenofibric acid
H01672,D00473,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.",Immune system disease,Prednisone

H01593,D10841,Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a generalised reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and an increased risk of fracture. Since BMD values fall progressively with age, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of all women will have osteoporosis by the age of 80. Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Ropinirole hydrochloride

H01695,D00978,Erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects.

H00079,D05429,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Aminophylline hydrate

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

Plasma levels of these amino acids in general are at the lower end of the normal range. Patients with cystinuria often present with nephro- or urolithiasis at almost at any age with a clear preference in childhood due to elevated urinary cystine. Early diagnosis is important, as it allows prevention or diminution of kidney stones. Mutations in either interacting subunit SLC3A1 (rBAT) or SLC7A9 (b0,+AT) cause cystinuria.

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs.

H01730,D00601,Myocardial infarction,"Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a term for an event of heart attack. It is due to formation of plaques in the interior walls of the arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the heart and injuring heart muscles because of lack of oxygen supply. The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, nausea, epigastric discomfort, syncope, diaphoresis, and other factors. The diagnosis of MI is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical criteria, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, imaging studies and biomarkers used to detect death of cardiomyocytes. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack.

H01656,D03697,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Desoximetasone

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

H01490,D04554,Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Delavirdine mesylate
H01240,D05723,Immune thrombocytopenia,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder, and the most common cause of isolated thrombocytopenia in children. Destruction of autoantibody-sensitized platelets by Fc[gamma]R-bearing phagocytic cells in the reticuloendothelial system plays an important role. ITP is diagnosed clinically, based upon onset of thrombocytopenia in the absence of other hematologic abnormalities, or other causes of low platelets, and with a characteristic blood smear. While around 50% of typical childhood acute ITP is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection and commonly resolves within weeks to months without treatment, fewer adult cases are acute and self-resolving. Typical adult primary ITP is very similar clinically to chronic pediatric ITP. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and splenectomy (removal of the platelet-destructing organ) are effective treatment options.

H00630,D02598,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes.

H00079,D01929,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Tiotropium bromide hydrate

H01648,D00407,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Methylprednisolone

Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways.

They are usually benign but can give rise to severe clinical syndromes due to hormonal excess, or to visual/cranial disturbances due to mass effect. The tumor can be clinically nonfunctioning or hormone secreting. Among the latter, prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH)-secreting adenomas are the most common. The majority of pituitary adenomas arise sporadically, although a subset occurs as component tumors of well-characterized familial cancer syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), Carney complex (CNC), and MEN1-like syndrome (MEN4).",Endocrine and metabolic disease,Omeprazole
H01609,D00387,Insomnia,"Insomnia is a common disorder with a prevalence of about 10% in the general population. The most common complaints related to insomnia are difficulty initiating sleep (sleep-onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep due to prolonged nocturnal awakenings (sleep-maintenance insomnia), early morning awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from lack of sleep. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression, suicidality, and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line therapy. While behavioral therapies are effective for chronic insomnia in some patients, pharmacotherapy is frequently used when immediate short-term symptom relief is needed. The most effective pharmacologic therapies for insomnia are benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants.",Nervous system disease,Triazolam
H00020,D11555,Colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).",Cancer,Calcium levofolinate hydrate

Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC.

H01602,D05008,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which reflux of the stomach contents into the oesophagus results in symptoms or, occasionally, complications. GERD can be classified as non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or erosive reflux disease (ERD) based on the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal damage seen on endoscopy. ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Metoclopramide hydrochloride

H00083,D00752,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Mycophenolate mofetil

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs.

Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

The aetiology of acquired PRCA can be subclassified into primary and secondary. Primary PRCA is defined when no aetiology can be identified using available investigations. The causes of secondary PRCA are again diverse and can be due to infections (viral, bacterial, etc.), drugs (erythropoietin, carbamazepine, etc.), collagen vascular disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.), malignancies (e.g. thymoma), ABO-incompatible haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pregnancy. Depending on the cause, the course can be acute and self-limiting or chronic with rare spontaneous remissions. PRCA can be easily diagnosed when isolated anaemia, in the presence of normal white cell and platelet counts, is associated with a marrow of normal cellularity in which there is an almost complete absence of erythroblasts but normal myeloid cells and megakaryocytes.

Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Sirolimus

Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease.

H01649,D00799,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Trifluoperazine hydrochloride
H01490,D00746,Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy. Currently, 13 different drugs with ten different active components are licensed in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for the treatment of MS.",Nervous system disease,Interferon beta-1b

CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

Destruction of autoantibody-sensitized platelets by Fc[gamma]R-bearing phagocytic cells in the reticuloendothelial system plays an important role. ITP is diagnosed clinically, based upon onset of thrombocytopenia in the absence of other hematologic abnormalities, or other causes of low platelets, and with a characteristic blood smear. While around 50% of typical childhood acute ITP is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection and commonly resolves within weeks to months without treatment, fewer adult cases are acute and self-resolving. Typical adult primary ITP is very similar clinically to chronic pediatric ITP. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and splenectomy (removal of the platelet-destructing organ) are effective treatment options. It has been reported that the activating FCGR2C-ORF genotype predisposes to ITP by altering the balance of activating and inhibitory Fc[gamma]R on immune cells.",Primary immunodeficiency; Hematologic disease,Romiplostim

It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes.

H01674,D02598,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

In patients receiving long-term therapy, glucocorticoids induce fractures in 30 to 50% and osteonecrosis in 9 to 40%. The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor. Bisphosphonates are first-line options for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and may also be useful in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis.

Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

H00024,D06397,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators.

H00014,D10866,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

Blepharitis can be classified into anterior blepharitis and posterior blepharitis. Anterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the eyelid skin and eyelash follicles and may be accompanied by squamous debris or collarettes. Anterior blepharitis has classically been associated with Staphylococcus infection and seborrheic dermatitis. Posterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the meibomian glands and their orifices and may be a result of or cause of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is one cause of posterior blepharitis but others include infectious or allergic conjunctivitis, and rosacea.

H00019,D00208,Pancreatic cancer,"Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes.

H01648,D00981,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization.

H00031,D01155,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Gemcitabine hydrochloride
H01695,D00975,Erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects. To date, their use has been limited to EM major, as EM minor is self-limited.",Skin and connective tissue disease,Dexamethasone sodium phosphate

H00630,D02597,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA.",Autoimmune disease,Adalimumab

The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement (C5) leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a.

H01698,D00978,Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic and polygenic immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology. It is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals over the age of 50 in Western countries. It is characterized by inflammatory damage of the aorta and/or aortic branches, particularly the temporal artery, which can lead to severe complications such as blindness or cerebrovascular disorders. GCA is twice as common in women. It is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Laboratory tests usually reveal high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase proteins, anemia of chronic disease, and thrombocytosis. Genetic association studies have described several genes that are associated with predisposition to GCA, including genes of immune-inflammatory pathways and genes of the HLA class I and II regions. The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles seem to be the most consistently associated genetic risk factors for GCA. Outside the HLA region, the most significant loci included PTPN22. Glucocorticoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for GCA but are associated with frequent adverse events.

H01563,D08605,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Tipranavir

Among the Gram-positive anaerobes, there are cocci (primarily Peptostreptococcus) and sporeforming (Clostridium) and non-sporeforming bacilli (especially Actinomyces and Propionibacterium). In terms of frequency, there are four major sites of anaerobic infection - pleuropulmonary, intra-abdominal, female genital tract, and skin and soft tissue infections (with or without involvement of underlying bone). Infectious diseases caused by these anaerobes include following symptoms, bacteremia, brain abscess, neck space infections and infections following head and neck surgery, chronic sinusitis and otitis media, dental and oral infections, pleuropulmonary infections, intra-abdominal infections, female genital tract infections, non-puerperal breast abscesses and diabetic foot ulcers.",Infectious disease,Metronidazole

Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

H00007,D01275,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Doxorubicin hydrochloride
H01653,D01939,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Ziprasidone hydrochloride

H00014,D01155,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

H01502,D00981,Sjogren syndrome,"Sjogren Syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands leading to sicca symptoms of the eyes and mouth. Several systemic and extraglandular manifestations can develop, including fatigue, arthritis, and involvement of organs such as the skin, lungs, and kidneys. SS may occur as a primary disorder or in association with other systemic autoimmune diseases, traditionally defined as secondary SS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Salivary secretions from these patients exhibit elevated levels of antibodies and cytokines. This is accompanied by a reduction in oral phosphate levels and xerostomia due to reduced salivary flow, which can lead to infections, progressive caries, dysphagia and oral pain. Current tests for SS include sialometry, salivary scintigraphy, sialography, serological tests or minor salivary gland biopsies. Recently, salivary biomarkers of SS has been investigated. The etiology of SS is still unclear. Since there is a familial aggregation of primary SS, however, genetic factors have been suspected for a long time. Initially, HLA haplotypes were shown to be associated with primary SS.

H00079,D00973,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Cortisone acetate

CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease.

H00056,D00670,Alzheimer disease,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD.

Although the etiology of SAD is not yet fully established, twin and family studies suggest that SAD is heritable. Functional neuroimaging studies point to increased activity in amygdala and insula in patients with social anxiety disorder.

H00630,D02115,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes.

According to some studies, the incidence of the esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with BE is of about 0.5% per year. The major pathogenetic factor in the development of BE is represented by the gastroesophageal reflux disease. BE is characterized by the replacement of the normal squamous epithelium with the columnar epithelium, when the healing of the lesion occurs. Because only a minority of patients (around 10-15%) with gastroesophageal reflux disease have BE, additional factors that play important roles in determining the development of BE must concur.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

The characteristic symptoms include scaling, erythema, and itching, which occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons. Its prevalence is 1% to 3% in the general population and 34% to 83% in immunocompromised persons.

Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

H00003,D05029,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis.

Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes.

The urease of S. saprophyticus is known to be a virulent factor for the persistent infection in the urinary tract. All of the virulence factors of S. aureus, such as coagulase, hemolysins, enterotoxins, extracellular matrixbinding proteins, and exoenzymes, are absent in the S. saprophyticus genome. Besides S. saprophyticus is a leading gram-positive uropathogen of uncomplicated UTI, a restricted group of gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella spp. is often observed to cause uncomplicated UTI.",Infectious disease,Cefepime hydrochloride
H00056,D03822,Alzheimer disease,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.",Neurodegenerative disease,Rivastigmine

H00003,D00287,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as PML-RARalpha (in Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML), AML-ETO or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",Cancer,Cyclophosphamide

T-ALL comprises 15% of paediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases. T cell transformation is a multi-step process in which different genetic alterations cooperate to alter the normal mechanisms that control cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation during thymocyte development. In this context, constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling is the most prominent oncogenic pathway in T cell transformation. In addition, T-ALLs characteristically show the translocation and aberrant expression of transcription factor oncogenes.

It usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. Typical symptoms include episodic burning epigastric pain, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy. About 25 percent of patients with peptic ulcer have a serious complication such as hemorrhage, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction.

In IBS, there appears to be no organic substance or biochemical abnormality that can explain the symptoms. IBS can be classified into categories: constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D), mixed IBS (IBS-M), and un-subtyped IBS. Anticholinergic drugs, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, high molecular weight polymers (polycarbophil calcium), gastrointestinal motility regulators, probiotics preparations, and laxatives are used in the treatment of IBS. However, they are not uniformly effective. Several studies of patients with IBS suggest that this disorder aggregates in families, and thus, appears potentially heritable.

H01653,D04820,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Lurasidone hydrochloride

However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

The contribution of genetic factors to the development of AD is high. The best classical candidate genes for AD are alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both genes are involved in enzymatic degradation of alcohol. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported that the most robust associations for AD have been with such enzyme genes, especially ALDH2 in East Asian populations and ADH1B in European American and African American populations.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Disulfiram

Range of motion is decreased at the shoulder and pelvic girdles, and the neck and hip girdle may also be involved. These symptoms often persist for at least 1 month and are combined with incapacitating morning stiffness, a decline in general health, and an elevated acute-phase response. Onset of PMR symptoms may be acute or gradual. It is known that PMR patients share many pathogenetic features with giant cell arteritis (GCA). Despite the similarities in age of onset and some of the clinical manifestations, the relationship between GCA and PMR is not yet clearly established. One-third of PMR patients have systemic manifestations such as low-grade fever, malaise, and anorexia, but these are often milder than systemic symptoms in GCA patients. PMR is a benign and highly steroid-sensitive disease that should resolve fully with low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for 12-24 months, although one or two relapses may occur.

H01633,D11069,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide. Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H01656,D10400,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Tildrakizumab
H00042,D00254,Glioma,"Gliomas are the most common of the primary brain tumors and account for more than 40% of all central nervous system neoplasms. Gliomas include tumours that are composed predominantly of astrocytes (astrocytomas), oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogliomas), mixtures of various glial cells (for example,oligoastrocytomas) and ependymal cells (ependymomas). The most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma - glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - is one of the most aggressive human cancers. GBM may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM.",Cancer,Carmustine
H01664,D05374,Panic disorder,"Panic disorder (PD) is a common type of anxiety disorder, characterized by unexpected and repeated panic attacks or fear of future panic attacks. It has a rapid onset and includes symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, sweating and shaking. Some physical illnesses (e.g. asthma) commonly occur with panic disorder, and certain lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking) increase the risk for the disorder, but causal pathways are still unclear. In recent years, an association was found between panic symptoms and increased activity in the right frontal region of the brain. Genetic susceptibility factors also exist, but their exact nature and pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and several medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and benzodiazepines are effective for PD. Among these, SSRIs and SNRIs are considered to be first-line treatment agents because of their efficacy and favorable side effect profile.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Paroxetine hydrochloride
H00079,D09595,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate

It is a risk factor for subsequent depressive illness and substance abuse. Patients with SAD have an extreme fear of being negatively evaluated in social situations and, as a result, avoid social events or endure them with excessive fear or anxiety. Although the etiology of SAD is not yet fully established, twin and family studies suggest that SAD is heritable. Functional neuroimaging studies point to increased activity in amygdala and insula in patients with social anxiety disorder. In addition, there is evidence from various studies, that the serotonin, and dopamine neurotransmitter systems mediate the symptoms of SAD. A range of effective cognitive behavioural and pharmacological treatments now exists. However, they don't work for the 30-40% of patients.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Paroxetine hydrochloride
H01490,D01370,Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy. Currently, 13 different drugs with ten different active components are licensed in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for the treatment of MS.",Nervous system disease,Cladribine

Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.

H00003,D03259,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis.

Waning immunity after childhood immunization has resulted in a growing pool of susceptible adolescents and adults who are capable of transmitting pertussis to vulnerable unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants. The hallmark symptoms of pertussis are paroxysmal coughing with whooping and post-tussive vomiting. Persistent coughing may last for weeks to months with a gradual decrease in frequency and severity.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

H00004,D00168,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly.

H01633,D00600,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide. Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives. Blood pressure is a heritable trait; an estimated 30% of variance in blood pressure relates to genetic factors.

H01698,D00979,Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic and polygenic immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology. It is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals over the age of 50 in Western countries. It is characterized by inflammatory damage of the aorta and/or aortic branches, particularly the temporal artery, which can lead to severe complications such as blindness or cerebrovascular disorders. GCA is twice as common in women. It is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Laboratory tests usually reveal high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase proteins, anemia of chronic disease, and thrombocytosis. Genetic association studies have described several genes that are associated with predisposition to GCA, including genes of immune-inflammatory pathways and genes of the HLA class I and II regions. The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles seem to be the most consistently associated genetic risk factors for GCA. Outside the HLA region, the most significant loci included PTPN22. Glucocorticoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for GCA but are associated with frequent adverse events.

H01431,D11062,Cushing syndrome,"Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare disorder resulting from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids via exogenous and endogenous sources. The typical clinical features of CS are related to hypercortisolism and include accumulation of central fat, moon facies, neuromuscular weakness, osteoporosis or bone fractures, metabolic complications, and mood changes. Traditionally, endogenous CS is classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent (about 80%) or ACTH- independent (about 20%). Among ACTH-dependent forms, pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing's disease) is most common. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic, resulting from monoclonal expansion of a single mutated cell. Recently recurrent activating somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 gene (USP8) were identified in almost half of corticotroph adenoma. Germline mutations in MEN1 (encoding menin), AIP (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein), PRKAR1A (encoding cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit) and CDKN1B (encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; also known as p27 Kip1) have been identified in familial forms of pituitary adenomas. However, the frequency of familial pituitary adenomas is less than 5% in patients with pituitary adenomas. Among ACTH-independent CS, adrenal adenoma is most common. Rare adrenal causes of CS include primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) or primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD).",Endocrine and metabolic disease,Osilodrostat phosphate

These tumors, called gastrinomas, release gastrin to produce large amounts of acid that result in severe gastroesophageal peptic ulcer disease and diarrhea. Most ZES cases are sporadic, but about over 20 percent are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (see H00247). The clinical presentation is not specific for this disease and there is overlap of symptoms similar to those of a peptic ulcer. The most common symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by heartburn, nausea, and weight loss. Peptic ulceration complicated by bleeding is present in 25% of patients, and is more frequently in patients with sporadic ZES than in those with MEN1. In addition, the gastrinomas may be cancerous. The cancer can be spread to other parts of the body, most commonly to regional lymph nodes and the liver.

H00024,D02165,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Docetaxel
H01483,D04666,Acromegaly,"Acromegaly (ACM) is a disorder characterized by increased circulating GH and IGF-I (a GH-induced liver protein) levels that is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality. Patients with persistently elevated GH and IGF-I levels have an increased risk of multiple comorbidities, including left ventricular dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, arthritis, impaired glucose tolerance, and colonic polyps. Most cases of ACM occur as a result of a sporadic GH-secreting pituitary adenoma (PA). However, ACM can occur in a familial setting, either associated with other endocrine abnormalities or as an isolated disorder. Somatic activating mutations in the GNAS gene, which encodes for the Gs-alpha subunit of G-proteins, are found in up to 40% of sporadic GH-secreting PA. Familial ACM can occur in the context of rare inherited syndromes such as familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), which is caused in 15-20% of cases by aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene germline mutations.

In the case of B-ALL, numerous reports have demonstrated that recurring genetic abnormalities are associated with sufficiently unique clinical, immunophenotypic, and/or prognostic features so that they can be considered as distinct entities. The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) 'Philadelphia' chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners.

The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation.

H01648,D00979,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Methylprednisolone acetate

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents.

Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5.

PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects.

H00024,D02116,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Histrelin acetate

NHL includes malignant tumors of the lymphoid tissues variously resulting from the clonal growth of B cells, T cells and natural killer cells. NHL can be broadly classified based on the type of lymphocyte involved: B lymphocyte (B cell) or T lymphocyte (T cell) and is further classified by other factors, including whether it is aggressive or indolent. Aggressive NHL is fast-growing disease. It mainly includes mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. On the other hand, indolent NHL is slow-growing disease. It mainly includes follicular lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and MALT lymphoma.",Cancer,Doxorubicin hydrochloride
H01606,D00473,Polymyalgia rheumatica,"Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a relatively common inflammatory rheumatic disease in people older than 50 years of age. PMR is a clinical condition defined as the presence of inflammatory pain in the limb girdles. Range of motion is decreased at the shoulder and pelvic girdles, and the neck and hip girdle may also be involved. These symptoms often persist for at least 1 month and are combined with incapacitating morning stiffness, a decline in general health, and an elevated acute-phase response. Onset of PMR symptoms may be acute or gradual. It is known that PMR patients share many pathogenetic features with giant cell arteritis (GCA). Despite the similarities in age of onset and some of the clinical manifestations, the relationship between GCA and PMR is not yet clearly established. One-third of PMR patients have systemic manifestations such as low-grade fever, malaise, and anorexia, but these are often milder than systemic symptoms in GCA patients. PMR is a benign and highly steroid-sensitive disease that should resolve fully with low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for 12-24 months, although one or two relapses may occur. The diagnosis of PMR is made primarily on clinical grounds and is bolstered by laboratory evidence of an acute-phase reaction. There is no single diagnostic test for PMR, but sets of diagnostic and classification criteria have been suggested by several groups of investigators.",Musculoskeletal disease,Prednisone

A genetic defect in the filaggrin (FLG) protein and/or environmental factors are thought to cause AD by disrupting the epidermis. This disruption, in turn, results in contact between immune cells in the dermis and antigens from the external environment leading to intense itching, scratching, and inflammation.

Accumulated evidence suggests that both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the etiology of MDD although the pathogenesis of MDD remains unknown. Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Recently, selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs,) have become the first-line antidepressant drug treatment of depression and replaced tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to fewer side-effects and ease of use.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Paroxetine hydrochloride
H01642,D03231,Renal anemia,"Renal anemia is one of the most frequent complications of chronic kidney disease. Anemia leads to a decrease in oxygen delivery to vital organs, which is initially compensated for by tachycardia and cardiac hypertrophy, but eventually leads to the development of cardiovascular disease. Renal anemia is caused by the deficiency of endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) due to renal dysfunction. EPO is a glycoprotein hormone that has the role of the primary regulator of erythropoiesis. Formerly, treatment options were essentially limited to blood transfusions and androgen therapy, with its risks. However, since the late 1980s, the availability of recombinant human erythropoietin has revolutionized the management of renal anemia, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are now the mostly widely used drugs.",Urinary system disease,Epoetin alfa

H01670,D00825,Social anxiety disorder,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. SAD is generally considered a chronic disorder and has its onset during early adolescence. It is a risk factor for subsequent depressive illness and substance abuse. Patients with SAD have an extreme fear of being negatively evaluated in social situations and, as a result, avoid social events or endure them with excessive fear or anxiety. Although the etiology of SAD is not yet fully established, twin and family studies suggest that SAD is heritable. Functional neuroimaging studies point to increased activity in amygdala and insula in patients with social anxiety disorder. In addition, there is evidence from various studies, that the serotonin, and dopamine neurotransmitter systems mediate the symptoms of SAD. A range of effective cognitive behavioural and pharmacological treatments now exists. However, they don't work for the 30-40% of patients.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Sertraline hydrochloride
H01674,D00979,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

H01695,D00088,Erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects. To date, their use has been limited to EM major, as EM minor is self-limited.",Skin and connective tissue disease,Hydrocortisone
H00003,D10679,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis.

H01635,D11092,Hyperlipidemia,"Dyslipidemia is a condition characterized by either an increase or decrease in concentration of lipids in the blood. Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and combined hyperlipidemia refer to elevations involving the major cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (LDL), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL), and both, respectively.",Metabolic disease,Pitavastatin magnesium

T-ALL comprises 15% of paediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases. T cell transformation is a multi-step process in which different genetic alterations cooperate to alter the normal mechanisms that control cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation during thymocyte development. In this context, constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling is the most prominent oncogenic pathway in T cell transformation. In addition, T-ALLs characteristically show the translocation and aberrant expression of transcription factor oncogenes.

PTH is a key calcium regulating hormone essential for calcium homeostasis, vitamin D-dependant calcium absorption, renal calcium reabsorption and renal phosphate clearance. Hypocalcemic patients can present with a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, cramping, tetany, seizures and congestive heart failure. Mild chronic hypocalcemia can be asymptomatic. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is iatrogenic in the setting of anterior neck surgery. Hypoparathyroidism may be due to congenital or acquired disorders. Causes include autoimmune diseases, genetic abnormalities, destruction or infiltrative disorders of the parathyroids. Hypoparathyroidism may be further classified as isolated or syndromic. Genetic syndromes with hypoparathyroidism include DiGeorge syndrome (H01524), HDR syndrome (H01271), Kenny-Caffey syndrome (H00619), Kearns-Sayre syndrome (H01355), and so on. Isolated hypoparathyroidism has been reported as apparently sporadic, or as a familial trait with either autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X chromosome-linked inheritance. Mutations in the preproPTH gene have been described in both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of familial isolated hypoparathyroidism.

H01604,D00473,Polymyositis and dermatomyositis,"Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.",Musculoskeletal disease,Prednisone
H00079,D00978,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Hydrocortisone sodium succinate
H00014,D00491,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Paclitaxel

Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy.

H01672,D00973,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome.

Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Levodopa
H01694,D00975,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes. There is still no consensus on a definite treatment method for SJS-TEN.

H00020,D10137,Colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

H00007,D10574,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Pembrolizumab

It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Apremilast

Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

H01604,D00292,Polymyositis and dermatomyositis,"Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects.

Narcolepsy is a rare and mainly sporadic disorder. Familial narcolepsy accounts for less than 10% of all narcolepsy cases, and causative mutations have not been identified to date. The discovery of hypocretin-1 (HCRT) deficiency shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. The hypocretin neurotransmission system was shown to play a major role in controlling vigilance states. Because of the strong HLA association, hypocretin deficiency is believed to be caused by an autoimmune attack.

H01634,D00481,Peptic ulcer,"Peptic ulcer is a common disorder of gastrointestinal system characterized by mucosal damage secondary to pepsin and gastric acid secretion. It usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. Typical symptoms include episodic burning epigastric pain, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy.

H01602,D11706,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which reflux of the stomach contents into the oesophagus results in symptoms or, occasionally, complications. GERD can be classified as non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or erosive reflux disease (ERD) based on the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal damage seen on endoscopy. ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Methoxsalen

H01604,D00146,Polymyositis and dermatomyositis,"Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.",Musculoskeletal disease,Corticotropin

Despite high vaccination rates, this illness has re-emerged worldwide, causing approximately 300 000 deaths each year. Waning immunity after childhood immunization has resulted in a growing pool of susceptible adolescents and adults who are capable of transmitting pertussis to vulnerable unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants. The hallmark symptoms of pertussis are paroxysmal coughing with whooping and post-tussive vomiting. Persistent coughing may last for weeks to months with a gradual decrease in frequency and severity. However, it should be noted that B. pertussis infections, particularly in hosts with partial immunity to the bacterium, may also follow a much milder or subclinical course.

COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations.

H01648,D00473,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Prednisone

H01602,D00295,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which reflux of the stomach contents into the oesophagus results in symptoms or, occasionally, complications. GERD can be classified as non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or erosive reflux disease (ERD) based on the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal damage seen on endoscopy. ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Cimetidine

PIG-A is required for the biosynthesis of a lipid moiety, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), that attaches dozens of different proteins to the cell surface. PIG-A mutations block GPI anchor biosynthesis, resulting in a deficiency or absence of all GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface. This deficiency on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis since certain GPI anchored proteins normally function as complement regulators.",Hematologic disease,Ravulizumab
H01672,D11576,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.",Immune system disease,Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium
H01532,D00118,Gout,"Gout is a kind of arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. It is triggered due to precipitation and deposition of inflammatory monosodium urate crystals in synovial and other tissues, accompanied by severe pain. The most common symptom include swelling, tenderness, warmth and redness. Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease. Epidemiology studies reported that the excessive intake of alcohol and purine rich food, which excessively produce uric acid, leads to accumulation of uric acid.",Musculoskeletal disease,Naproxen
H01633,D00627,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide. Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives. Blood pressure is a heritable trait; an estimated 30% of variance in blood pressure relates to genetic factors. Understanding of the genetic architecture of traits has progressed in rare mendelian hypertensive phenotypes, such as Gordon's syndrome.",Cardiovascular disease,Telmisartan
H01641,D10374,Dry eye desease,"Dry eye disease (also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca) is multifactorial disease of the tears, lids, and ocular surface which can result in symptoms of discomfort and/or visual disturbance and/or tear film instability with the potential for damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and subacute inflammation of the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common. Aqueous insufficiency is divided into two main groups: Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye and non-Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye (which includes the use of systemic medication). Dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) [DS:H01502] is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual's last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer's test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye. The benefit of long-term topical anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate or severe dry eye disease with corticosteroids or cyclosporine A eye drops has been documented in clinical trials on a high evidence level. Orally administered tetraycycline derivatives and omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids are also used.",Nervous system disease,Lifitegrast
H01653,D00426,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Risperidone
H01652,D00351,Seborrheic dermatitis,"Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory dermatological disorder. The characteristic symptoms include scaling, erythema, and itching, which occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons. Its prevalence is 1% to 3% in the general population and 34% to 83% in immunocompromised persons. Topical antifungal agents are the first-line therapy for acute and long-term treatment of SD of the face and body. Treatment includes over-the-counter shampoos and topical antifungals, calcineurin inhibitors, and corticosteroids.",Skin and connective tissue disease,Ketoconazole
H00083,D00238,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Azathioprine

The most common complaints related to insomnia are difficulty initiating sleep (sleep-onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep due to prolonged nocturnal awakenings (sleep-maintenance insomnia), early morning awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from lack of sleep. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression, suicidality, and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line therapy. While behavioral therapies are effective for chronic insomnia in some patients, pharmacotherapy is frequently used when immediate short-term symptom relief is needed. The most effective pharmacologic therapies for insomnia are benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants.",Nervous system disease,Diphenhydramine hydrochloride
H00013,D11644,Small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.",Cancer,Lurbinectedin
H00004,D09951,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.",Cancer,Ponatinib hydrochloride

Current tests for SS include sialometry, salivary scintigraphy, sialography, serological tests or minor salivary gland biopsies. Recently, salivary biomarkers of SS has been investigated. The etiology of SS is still unclear. Since there is a familial aggregation of primary SS, however, genetic factors have been suspected for a long time.

H00079,D00981,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Prednisolone sodium phosphate
H01698,D00983,Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic and polygenic immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology. It is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals over the age of 50 in Western countries. It is characterized by inflammatory damage of the aorta and/or aortic branches, particularly the temporal artery, which can lead to severe complications such as blindness or cerebrovascular disorders. GCA is twice as common in women. It is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Laboratory tests usually reveal high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase proteins, anemia of chronic disease, and thrombocytosis. Genetic association studies have described several genes that are associated with predisposition to GCA, including genes of immune-inflammatory pathways and genes of the HLA class I and II regions. The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles seem to be the most consistently associated genetic risk factors for GCA. Outside the HLA region, the most significant loci included PTPN22. Glucocorticoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for GCA but are associated with frequent adverse events. Tocilizumab, a humanised antihuman IL-6 receptor antibody, has been used successfully in several reports as a treatment of GCA.",Immune system disease; Cardiovascular disease; Nervous system disease,Triamcinolone acetonide
H01635,D03582,Hyperlipidemia,"Dyslipidemia is a condition characterized by either an increase or decrease in concentration of lipids in the blood. Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and combined hyperlipidemia refer to elevations involving the major cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (LDL), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL), and both, respectively.",Metabolic disease,Colesevelam hydrochloride
H01593,D10885,Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a generalised reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and an increased risk of fracture. Since BMD values fall progressively with age, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of all women will have osteoporosis by the age of 80. Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

H01621,D10135,Pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Together, these observations support a prominent role for TGF-beta family members in the development of PAH.",Cardiovascular disease,Macitentan

The clinical spectrum may vary from intermittent inflammatory episodes leading to unesthetic structural deformities to life-threatening cardiopulmonary manifestations, such as airway collapse and valvular regurgitation. The diagnosis of RP is largely based on the clinical features and the role of laboratory investigations is purely supportive and to rule out other related or associated systemic diseases.

H01648,D00088,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Hydrocortisone
H01563,D00413,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Zidovudine

H00014,D10104,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Dabrafenib mesylate

The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement (C5) leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a.

H00003,D01275,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as PML-RARalpha (in Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML), AML-ETO or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes.

H01450,D00811,Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Clomipramine hydrochloride

H01694,D00983,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes.

H01695,D00472,Erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects.

Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride

Tonic seizures during sleep are the feature often used as the foundation for diagnosis. LGS is characterized by multiple concurrent seizure types, including tonic, atypical absence seizures, atonic, and myoclonic jerks. Non-convulsive status epilepticus, lasting days to weeks, occurs in half of patients. The etiology of LGS is heterogeneous and includes both genetic and acquired causes. LGS most commonly first manifests in children between 3 and 5 years of age, but onset can also occur at younger and older ages.

The presentation of this disease is bimodal, with peaks in adolescence and after the age of 50 years. The tumors typically arise in the metaphyseal regions of long bones, with the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus representing the three most common sites. Genomic amplification, especially of both the p53-binding MDM2 gene and the flanking SAS gene, plays an important role in the biology of these tumors.

H01532,D00475,Gout,"Gout is a kind of arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. It is triggered due to precipitation and deposition of inflammatory monosodium urate crystals in synovial and other tissues, accompanied by severe pain. The most common symptom include swelling, tenderness, warmth and redness. Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H00031,D04645,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

It is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and abnormal bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation. In IBS, there appears to be no organic substance or biochemical abnormality that can explain the symptoms. IBS can be classified into categories: constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D), mixed IBS (IBS-M), and un-subtyped IBS. Anticholinergic drugs, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, high molecular weight polymers (polycarbophil calcium), gastrointestinal motility regulators, probiotics preparations, and laxatives are used in the treatment of IBS. However, they are not uniformly effective. Several studies of patients with IBS suggest that this disorder aggregates in families, and thus, appears potentially heritable.

H01649,D00426,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Risperidone

H00007,D00266,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Chlorambucil

This disease is the result of injury to the respiratory and terminal bronchioles from a wide variety of potential causes. Although the pathogenesis of OB remains poorly understood, it seems clear that a multifaceted process of inflammation and resultant fibrotic transition occurs, resulting in airflow limitation and development of disease. Although OB has been described in all age groups, the frequency of underlying causes and potential prognoses are different for children and adults. For example, OB in children is most often seen following a severe lower-respiratory-tract infection, usually of adenovirus, whereas OB in adults is more commonly associated with occupational inhalation injuries, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and autoimmune disorders. In lung transplant recipients, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the major cause of death after the first year of transplantation and is a form of allograft rejection.

The less common, accounting for about one-third of cases, occurs in relatively young women, is usually preceded by the undifferentiated form of vulvar squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; the more frequent form develops in elderly patients, is not commonly associated with undifferentiated VIN but is frequently associated with differentiated VIN, lichen sclerosus or squamous hyperplasia, and is generally not linked to HPV infection. Relatively little is known about molecular changes in the genesis of vulvar cancer. Some studies suggest that early p53 mutation may be a defining step only in HPV-negative tumors.

There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

H00021,D10316,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.",Cancer,Nivolumab

H01532,D09316,Gout,"Gout is a kind of arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. It is triggered due to precipitation and deposition of inflammatory monosodium urate crystals in synovial and other tissues, accompanied by severe pain. The most common symptom include swelling, tenderness, warmth and redness. Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease.

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy.

Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Prednisolone

RMS comprises a heterogeneous into two major histologic subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS). Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a pediatric sarcoma that typically occurs in older children predominantly arising in the trunk and extremities, and exhibits a worse prognosis than other types of RMSs. ARMS is associated with 2;13 or 1;13 chromosomal translocations, which generate PAX3-FOXO1A and PAX7-FOXO1A fusion products, respectively.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

H00079,D01703,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Ciclesonide

H00024,D06248,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators.

The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Etravirine

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate

This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy.

Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization.

H01714,D00688,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations.

HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Dacarbazine

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Methotrexate sodium

More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways.

H00083,D00981,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Prednisolone sodium phosphate

Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen.

Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.

H00079,D10295,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Mometasone furoate and formoterol fumarate
H01491,D03940,Neuromyelitis optica,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic's disease is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that selectively affects optic nerves and spinal cord. The etiology of NMO is unknown but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder triggered by an environmental factor, possibly an infection, in genetically susceptible individuals. The principal effector in NMO is the self-reactive, complement-activating anti-AQP4 antibody. AQP4 water channel is a component of the dystroglycan protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the blood-brain barrier. Anti-AQP4 antibody is sensitive and highly specific serum markers of autoimmune NMO. For many decades, NMO was considered to be a subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS), but prognosis and optimal treatments differ. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange (PLEX) are the most commonly used therapeutic modalities in acute settings. Corticosteroids exert global immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas PLEX removes antibodies, complement, and cytokines from the blood. Besides, immunosuppressant agents interfering with the function of T and B cells have been shown to prevent disease relapses and reduce neurological disability in NMO.",Immune system disease; Nervous system disease,Eculizumab

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H00014,D10574,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes.

Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

Progressive thyrocyte depletion results in impaired thyroid hormone production and clinical hypothyroidism, a condition that involves a marked reduction of metabolic activity in various cells and tissues. AITDs are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.",Immune system disease,Levothyroxine sodium

The pathogenesis and progression of PGLs are very strongly influenced by genetics. A germline mutation in one of the susceptibility genes identified so far explains ~40% of all cases; the remaining 60% are thought to be sporadic cases. Sporadic as well as hereditary PGLs have been divided in two main clusters linked to two different signalling pathways: the first cluster contains all VHL-, SDHx-, and FH- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of hypoxic pathway, while the second cluster contains all RET- , NF1-, MAX and TMEM127- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of MAPK and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathways.",Cancer,Iobenguane I 131

H00056,D11387,Alzheimer disease,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD.

The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, nausea, epigastric discomfort, syncope, diaphoresis, and other factors. The diagnosis of MI is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical criteria, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, imaging studies and biomarkers used to detect death of cardiomyocytes. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack.

H00038,D02748,Melanoma,"Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

In the case of B-ALL, numerous reports have demonstrated that recurring genetic abnormalities are associated with sufficiently unique clinical, immunophenotypic, and/or prognostic features so that they can be considered as distinct entities. The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) 'Philadelphia' chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners.

AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis.

Cigarette smoking has been implicated as the main etiology of the disease. Although Buerger's disease has a worldwide distribution, it is more prevalent in the Middle East and Far East and classically develops in male smokers younger than 45 years. There may be a predisposition to development of Buerger's disease, although no gene has been identified to date. The most common symptom is pain at rest and claudication in the affected hands or feet. Other symptoms include cold insensitivity, diminished peripheral pulses, cyanosis, skin atrophy, and reduced hair growth. As the disease progresses, patients will develop ischemic ulcerations and eventually gangrene. Abstinence from smoking is the definitive treatment to prevent disease progression.

Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome.

Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Safinamide mesylate

Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways.

H00004,D06109,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

H00079,D09874,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Benralizumab

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs.

H00014,D06409,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

H00004,D00248,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.",Cancer,Busulfan
H00024,D04071,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,"Estrogens, esterified"

H00031,D11934,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

RPCA can be classified into congenital and acquired. Congenital PRCA is also known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia [DS:H00237] and is a disease of infancy and early childhood. The aetiology of acquired PRCA can be subclassified into primary and secondary. Primary PRCA is defined when no aetiology can be identified using available investigations.

ITP is diagnosed clinically, based upon onset of thrombocytopenia in the absence of other hematologic abnormalities, or other causes of low platelets, and with a characteristic blood smear. While around 50% of typical childhood acute ITP is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection and commonly resolves within weeks to months without treatment, fewer adult cases are acute and self-resolving. Typical adult primary ITP is very similar clinically to chronic pediatric ITP. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and splenectomy (removal of the platelet-destructing organ) are effective treatment options.

H01648,D00983,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Triamcinolone acetonide

Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes.

H01563,D11282,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Dolutegravir sodium and rilpivirine hydrochloride

H01672,D00088,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.",Immune system disease,Hydrocortisone

MF presents in the skin with erythematous patches, plaques, and less frequently, tumours. Although the aetiologies of MF are unknown, important insights have been gained in the immunological and genetic perturbations that are associated with these diseases. Mutations in the p53, p15, p16, JunB, and PTEN genes generally occur in later-stage disease. Loss of normal apoptotic T-cell pathways has also been reported. Apoptosis is partly mediated by death receptors, notably Fas, which is part of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. Decreased and/or defective Fas expression by neoplastic T cells has been associated with advanced/aggressive disease and impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis.",Cancer,Cortisone acetate
H00003,D00168,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as PML-RARalpha (in Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML), AML-ETO or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.",Cancer,Cytarabine
H01602,D00440,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which reflux of the stomach contents into the oesophagus results in symptoms or, occasionally, complications. GERD can be classified as non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or erosive reflux disease (ERD) based on the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal damage seen on endoscopy. ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Nizatidine
H01694,D00973,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes. There is still no consensus on a definite treatment method for SJS-TEN. Systemic steroids and IVIG are used most frequently in medical treatment and treatment options including cyclosporine, plasmapheresis and hemodialysis are required more rarely.",Skin and connective tissue disease,Cortisone acetate
H00031,D00491,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Paclitaxel

The laryngeal angioedema is potentially lethal. The classic forms, HAE types I and II, result from deficiency of the plasma protease inhibitor, C1 inhibitor (C1INH). Type I HAE is caused by decreased expression of C1INH in the plasma whereas type 2 HAE, consisting approximately 15% of patients with HAE, is due to expression of a dysfunctional C1INH protein.

CD is considered a form of primary adult-onset focal dystonia. The majority of patients complain of pain, which is not a common feature of other focal dystonias. Head rotation is common, but head tilt, neck extension, and flexionmay also occur, often in combination. The pathogenesis of primary CD is unclear. Patients with secondary CD may have an abnormal birth or developmental history, exposure to drugs known to cause dystonia (tardive dystonia), or neurological illness.

H01589,D02176,Systemic primary carnitine deficiency,"Systemic primary carnitine deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, hypoglycemic hypoketotic coma, and hyperammonemia. Carnitine plays essential roles in the transportation of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. This disease is caused by mutations in SLC22A5 that encodes the high-affinity sodium-dependent carnitine transporter, organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2). The hallmark of systemic primary carnitine deficiency is low concentrations of carnitine in plasma, with accumulation of lipid deposits and renal leakage of carnitine. The clinical symptoms are alleviated dramatically by oral administration of L-carnitine.

H01532,D01206,Gout,"Gout is a kind of arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. It is triggered due to precipitation and deposition of inflammatory monosodium urate crystals in synovial and other tissues, accompanied by severe pain. The most common symptom include swelling, tenderness, warmth and redness. Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H00021,D06409,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.",Cancer,Bevacizumab

First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

H01648,D02994,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Rituximab
H01656,D00233,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Anthralin
H01053,D03940,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an uncommon intravascular hemolytic anemia that results from the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells harboring somatic mutations in an X-linked gene, termed PIG-A. PIG-A is required for the biosynthesis of a lipid moiety, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), that attaches dozens of different proteins to the cell surface. PIG-A mutations block GPI anchor biosynthesis, resulting in a deficiency or absence of all GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface.

H01645,D00562,Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a pathological disorder characterised by increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland. The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission. In patients with toxic nodular goiter, ATDs are generally used to restore euthyroidism before definitive treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, and infrequently used as long-term treatment when the other two therapies are contraindicated or the patient has a short life expectancy.",Endocrine disease,Propylthiouracil

Most ZES cases are sporadic, but about over 20 percent are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (see H00247). The clinical presentation is not specific for this disease and there is overlap of symptoms similar to those of a peptic ulcer. The most common symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by heartburn, nausea, and weight loss. Peptic ulceration complicated by bleeding is present in 25% of patients, and is more frequently in patients with sporadic ZES than in those with MEN1. In addition, the gastrinomas may be cancerous.

In the case of B-ALL, numerous reports have demonstrated that recurring genetic abnormalities are associated with sufficiently unique clinical, immunophenotypic, and/or prognostic features so that they can be considered as distinct entities. The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) 'Philadelphia' chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners.

H01601,D09587,Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma,"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a lymphoid neoplasm characterized by a proliferation of large lymphoid cells, referred to as hallmark cells, with strong expression of CD30. The World Health Organization recognizes 3 entities: primary cutaneous ALCL (pcALCL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALCL, and, provisionally, ALK-negative ALCL. pcALCL presents in the skin and, while it may involve locoregional lymph nodes, rarely disseminates. ALK-positive ALCL, by definition overexpresses an ALK-fusion gene, typically via t(2;5)(p23;35) which fuses the ALK gene on chromosome 2 with the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5, resulting in a NPM-ALK chimeric protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. ALK-negative ALCLs lack ALK rearrangements and their genetic and clinical features are more variable. A subset of ALK-negative ALCLs has rearrangements at 6p25.3 involving DUSP22, a gene encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits T-cell receptor signaling. DUSP22 rearrangements also are seen in a subset of pcALCLs.",Cancer,Brentuximab vedotin
H01653,D10516,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Aripiprazole hydrate
H00021,D10574,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.",Cancer,Pembrolizumab

H01703,D04747,Eating Disorders,"Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), are disorders defined by disturbances in eating behavior. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors. In addition, an association between the BDNF gene polymorphism and eating disorders has been demonstrated. Other genetic risk factors for eating disorders has also been reported.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate
H00031,D00967,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Toremifene citrate
H00079,D11630,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Aminophylline dihydrate

Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.",Cancer,Topotecan hydrochloride

The symptoms include generalised and persistent excessive anxiety and a combination of various psychological and somatic complaints, such as threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, tension, palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. The symptoms overlap greatly with those of other mental disorders and we could regard the disorder as part of a spectrum of mood and related disorders rather than an independent disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder has a relapsing course, and intervention rarely results in complete resolution of symptoms.

H00007,D02197,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Vincristine sulfate
H01595,D00979,Cutaneous lupus erythematosus,"Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is the skin-related form of lupus erythematosus (LE), with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and a variable course. CLE is a frequent finding in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can also exist as a single entity without associated systemic autoimmunity (LE-specific skin disease). Despite ongoing research into the cause of CLE, it remains unclear how CLE relates to SLE pathogenesis. LE-specific skin disease includes the subtypes of CLE such as acute cutaneous LE (ACLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE), and intermittent CLE (ICLE). ACLE is characterized by malar rash or maculopapular eruption on sun exposed areas. SCLE characteristically presents as annular or psoriasiform plaques in a photo distribution. CCLE can be further divided into discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), LE profundus (LEP), chilblain LE (CLE), and LE tumidus (LET). The pathogenesis of CLE is multifactorial and involves genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and abnormalities in the immune response. It has been reported that many genetic risk factors for CLE involve HLA or interferon-related pathways.

H00003,D05803,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H01674,D11576,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

H00031,D11141,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Tucatinib

Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.

H00057,D00777,Parkinson disease,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Amantadine hydrochloride

Most MPN patients harbor an acquired mutation in the hemopoietic cells, the V617F mutation, located in the pseudokinase domain of the JAK2 gene. This mutation results in a gain of function, i.e., in the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which plays an important role in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the hemopoietic cells, as well as in the immune function. Besides, a minority of patients with MF (most of them negative for the JAK2 mutation) harbor other JAK-STAT-activating mutation, the MPL mutation, in the gene of the receptor of the thrombopoietin. Recently, mutations in the CALR gene have been described in 86% of cases with primary MF that are negative for JAK2 or MPL mutations. CALR mutation also showed cytokine independent growth of cells due to activation of STAT5 involved with the JAK-STAT pathway but its exact role in MPN remains to be clarified.",Cancer,Fedratinib hydrochloride

H01563,D08775,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

H00010,D11870,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

Gliomas include tumours that are composed predominantly of astrocytes (astrocytomas), oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogliomas), mixtures of various glial cells (for example,oligoastrocytomas) and ependymal cells (ependymomas). The most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma - glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - is one of the most aggressive human cancers. GBM may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations.

H01240,D09348,Immune thrombocytopenia,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder, and the most common cause of isolated thrombocytopenia in children. Destruction of autoantibody-sensitized platelets by Fc[gamma]R-bearing phagocytic cells in the reticuloendothelial system plays an important role. ITP is diagnosed clinically, based upon onset of thrombocytopenia in the absence of other hematologic abnormalities, or other causes of low platelets, and with a characteristic blood smear. While around 50% of typical childhood acute ITP is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection and commonly resolves within weeks to months without treatment, fewer adult cases are acute and self-resolving. Typical adult primary ITP is very similar clinically to chronic pediatric ITP. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and splenectomy (removal of the platelet-destructing organ) are effective treatment options.

H00007,D00287,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Cyclophosphamide

T-ALL comprises 15% of paediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases. T cell transformation is a multi-step process in which different genetic alterations cooperate to alter the normal mechanisms that control cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation during thymocyte development. In this context, constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling is the most prominent oncogenic pathway in T cell transformation. In addition, T-ALLs characteristically show the translocation and aberrant expression of transcription factor oncogenes.

Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha.

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

Recently, selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs,) have become the first-line antidepressant drug treatment of depression and replaced tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to fewer side-effects and ease of use.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Desvenlafaxine succinate
H00079,D00414,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5.

H00031,D02714,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome.

The etiology of NMO is unknown but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder triggered by an environmental factor, possibly an infection, in genetically susceptible individuals. The principal effector in NMO is the self-reactive, complement-activating anti-AQP4 antibody. AQP4 water channel is a component of the dystroglycan protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the blood-brain barrier. Anti-AQP4 antibody is sensitive and highly specific serum markers of autoimmune NMO. For many decades, NMO was considered to be a subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS), but prognosis and optimal treatments differ. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange (PLEX) are the most commonly used therapeutic modalities in acute settings. Corticosteroids exert global immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas PLEX removes antibodies, complement, and cytokines from the blood.

Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear.

H01648,D00472,Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization.

Reports implicate variants of genes important for the synthesis, uptake, transport and receptor binding of dopamine in the etiology of ADHD. And interaction between the dopamine and serotonin systems has been implicated in both the pathophysiology of ADHD and the mechanism of action of widely used stimulant compounds.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Amphetamine sulfate

POAG is often accompanied by ocular hypertension and characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, atrophy of the optic nerve, and visual field loss. To date, at least 20 genetic loci for POAG have been reported. And four causative genes (CYP1B1, MYOC, OPTN, and WDR36) are identified from these loci.

H01586,D00983,Acquired pure red cell aplasia,"Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare condition characterised by selective inhibition and the absence of red cell precursors in the bone marrow with consequent anaemia and reticulocytopenia in the presence of normal granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages. RPCA can be classified into congenital and acquired. Congenital PRCA is also known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia [DS:H00237] and is a disease of infancy and early childhood. The aetiology of acquired PRCA can be subclassified into primary and secondary. Primary PRCA is defined when no aetiology can be identified using available investigations. The causes of secondary PRCA are again diverse and can be due to infections (viral, bacterial, etc.), drugs (erythropoietin, carbamazepine, etc.), collagen vascular disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.), malignancies (e.g. thymoma), ABO-incompatible haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pregnancy. Depending on the cause, the course can be acute and self-limiting or chronic with rare spontaneous remissions. PRCA can be easily diagnosed when isolated anaemia, in the presence of normal white cell and platelet counts, is associated with a marrow of normal cellularity in which there is an almost complete absence of erythroblasts but normal myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. Primary, or secondary PRCA not responding to treatment of the underlying diseases, is treated as an immunologically-mediated disease. The therapeutic plan usually focuses on the sequential use of various immunosuppressive therapies until a remission is obtained.",Hematologic disease; Immune system disease,Triamcinolone acetonide
H00022,D01275,Bladder cancer,"The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).",Cancer,Doxorubicin hydrochloride
H00038,D00288,Melanoma,"Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

H01669,D00122,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a chronic and progressive disorder characterized by elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and disturbances in mineral metabolism, mainly calcium and phosphorus. SHPT is generally caused by diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia in response to prolonged reduced levels of extracellular calcium from various secondary aetiologies. Although it is initially and adaptive response to a variety of stimuli resulting mainly in extracellular hypocalcaemia (vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, idiopathic hypercalciuria, calcium malabsorption), long-standing SHPT may eventually develop into autonomous HPT (ie, tertiary HPT). Because SHPT is a compensatory mechanism of the parathyroid glands, it commonly resolves with normalization of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. After excluding reversible secondary aetiologies, first-line treatment of irreversible SHPT (often related to chronic kidney disease) mainly involves medical therapies.",Endocrine disease,Calcifediol
H01674,D00118,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression. The most frequently applied biological agents approved for AS are TNF alpha inhibitors.

H00083,D02714,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Everolimus

H00630,D00184,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA.",Autoimmune disease,Cyclosporine

H00079,D00529,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5.

H01604,D00978,Polymyositis and dermatomyositis,"Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.",Musculoskeletal disease,Hydrocortisone sodium succinate

There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy.

The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H01652,D05815,Seborrheic dermatitis,"Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory dermatological disorder. The characteristic symptoms include scaling, erythema, and itching, which occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons. Its prevalence is 1% to 3% in the general population and 34% to 83% in immunocompromised persons.

COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking.

H01714,D00687,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Salmeterol xinafoate
H00004,D06413,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.",Cancer,Nilotinib hydrochloride hydrate
H00024,D09400,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Degarelix acetate
H01709,D03234,Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis,"Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is a common and severe adverse event. Glucocorticoid use is one of the most important causes of osteonecrosis. In patients receiving long-term therapy, glucocorticoids induce fractures in 30 to 50% and osteonecrosis in 9 to 40%. The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor. Bisphosphonates are first-line options for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and may also be useful in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis.

H00022,D02697,Bladder cancer,"The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).",Cancer,Valrubicin
H01653,D00354,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Lamotrigine
H00079,D00411,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Zafirlukast

The discovery of hypocretin-1 (HCRT) deficiency shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. The hypocretin neurotransmission system was shown to play a major role in controlling vigilance states. Because of the strong HLA association, hypocretin deficiency is believed to be caused by an autoimmune attack.

H00031,D11011,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, nausea, epigastric discomfort, syncope, diaphoresis, and other factors. The diagnosis of MI is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical criteria, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, imaging studies and biomarkers used to detect death of cardiomyocytes. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack.

HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Brentuximab vedotin

Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons. Its prevalence is 1% to 3% in the general population and 34% to 83% in immunocompromised persons.

H00056,D02173,Alzheimer disease,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD.

H00014,D01977,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Tiotropium bromide hydrate

Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. The morphologic differences in these cancers are mirrored in their molecular genetic profile with type I showing defects in DNA-mismatch repair and mutations in PTEN, K-ras, and beta-catenin, and type II showing aneuploidy, p53 mutations, and her2/neu amplification.",Cancer,Medroxyprogesterone acetate

Although tuberculosis remains a significant cause in developing countries, autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of Addison disease in developed nations. It has also been reported that DAX1 mutations result in X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (X-linked Addison disease). The clinical manifestations before a life-threatening adrenal crisis (shock, hypotension, and volume depletion) are subtle and can include hyperpigmentation, fatigue, anorexia, orthostasis, nausea, muscle and joint pain, and salt craving. Symptoms are gradual and worsen over a period of years, making early diagnosis difficult.

H00024,D10218,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Enzalutamide

Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Recently, selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs,) have become the first-line antidepressant drug treatment of depression and replaced tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to fewer side-effects and ease of use.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Bupropion hydrochloride

Most solid tumors are derived from epithelial cells. Carcinomas are tumors that form in epithelial cells. Neoplastic epithelial cells generate aggressive cancers such as those located in the lung, breast, colon, prostate and ovary. Some cancers of the bladder ureters and kidneys are transitional cell carcinomas. Sarcomas are tumors that start in tissues like a blood vessel, bone, fat tissue, ligament, lymph vessel, muscle or tendon.

H01490,D02274,Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

H00038,D11053,Melanoma,"Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy.

Most ZES cases are sporadic, but about over 20 percent are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (see H00247). The clinical presentation is not specific for this disease and there is overlap of symptoms similar to those of a peptic ulcer. The most common symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by heartburn, nausea, and weight loss. Peptic ulceration complicated by bleeding is present in 25% of patients, and is more frequently in patients with sporadic ZES than in those with MEN1. In addition, the gastrinomas may be cancerous.

H01267,D00294,Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia,"Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy. Recent studies on the molecular basis of the disease have disclosed specific genetic defects in the regulation of insulin secretion. Seven different loci have been associated with hyperinsulinism: ABCC8, KCNJ11, HADHSC, GCK, GLUD1, SLC16A1, and INSR. Mutations of these loci have significant differences in phenotype and inheritance pattern. The most common genes associated with hyperinsulinism, involve the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes that encode the two subunits of the beta-cell ATP-dependent potassium channel. Recessive mutations of these genes cause a severe form of neonatal hypoglycemia that frequently requires near-total pancreatectomy. Diazoxide, a drug that acts as an agonist of the ATP-dependent potassium channel to suppress insulin secretion, is effective in defects associated with mutations of GLUD1 and HADHSC.

HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Vinblastine sulfate

It is now understood that ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma are the same disease entities at the morphologic and immunophenotypic levels and classified as either B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL and T-ALL). In the case of B-ALL, numerous reports have demonstrated that recurring genetic abnormalities are associated with sufficiently unique clinical, immunophenotypic, and/or prognostic features so that they can be considered as distinct entities. The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) 'Philadelphia' chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners.

In patients receiving long-term therapy, glucocorticoids induce fractures in 30 to 50% and osteonecrosis in 9 to 40%. The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor. Bisphosphonates are first-line options for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and may also be useful in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis.

Several genetic changes have been identified in intestinal-type GC. The intestinal metaplasia is characterized by mutations in p53 gene, reduced expression of retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR-beta) and hTERT expression. Gastric adenomas furthermore display mutations in the APC gene, reduced p27 expression and cyclin E amplification. In addition, amplification and overexpression of c-ErbB2, reduced TGF-beta receptor type I (TGFBRI) expression and complete loss of p27 expression are commonly observed in more advanced GC.

Moreover, AIHAs are classified in primary (idiopathic), in which hemolysis dominates the clinical picture in the absence of any other coexisting disorder, and in secondary forms, accompanying and complicating an underlying disease. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia.

Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

H00630,D00146,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

H01694,D00979,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes. There is still no consensus on a definite treatment method for SJS-TEN.

The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, nausea, epigastric discomfort, syncope, diaphoresis, and other factors. The diagnosis of MI is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical criteria, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, imaging studies and biomarkers used to detect death of cardiomyocytes. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack.

Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

H01654,D00985,Lichen planus,"Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory and immune mediated skin disease with characteristic clinical and histopathologic features. The skin and oral mucosa are the most frequently involved areas. Other mucous membranes (including the genitalia, esophagus, and conjunctiva) and skin appendages (e.g., scalp hair and nails) can also be affected. The etiology and pathogenesis of LP remain unclear. An autoimmune reaction in which CD8+-T lymphocytes attack basal keratinocytes leading to apoptosis of the cells has been favored. Various potential triggers, e.g. viral or bacterial antigens, metal ions, drugs or physical factors, could initiate the autoimmune process. Nonetheless, the role of the individual trigger factors is controversial. There is a significant association between lichen planus and infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The diagnosis of LP is based on the clinical presentation and should be confirmed by biopsy, if suspected. Histopathology is often conclusive, but in vesiculobullous cutaneous LP or erosive oral LP, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies can be an integral step in differentiating between LP and other diseases. With few exceptions, all forms of LP are treated with the same measures.

H00079,D10297,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Theophylline and dextrose
H00058,D01552,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. In 90% of patients, ALS is sporadic, with no clear genetic linkage. On the other hand, the remaining 10% of cases show familial inheritance, with mutations in SOD1, TDP43(TARDBP), FUS, or C9orf72 genes being the most frequent causes. In spite of such difference, familial ALS and sporadic ALS have similarities in their pathological features. Proposed disease mechanisms contributing to motor neuron degeneration in ALS are: impaired proteostasis, aberrant RNA processing, mitochondrial disfunction and oxidative stress, microglia activation, and axonal dysfunction.",Neurodegenerative disease,Edaravone
H00021,D10095,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.",Cancer,Cabozantinib s-malate
H01646,D05375,Major depressive disorder,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric disorder mainly characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, and a high risk of suicide. Accumulated evidence suggests that both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the etiology of MDD although the pathogenesis of MDD remains unknown. Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Recently, selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs,) have become the first-line antidepressant drug treatment of depression and replaced tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to fewer side-effects and ease of use.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Paroxetine mesylate

PS include idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and vascular Parkinsonism (VaP), among other rarer causes of parkinsonism. Point mutations, duplications and triplications in the alpha-synuclein gene cause a rare dominant form of PS in families. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been identified as a much more common cause for dominant PS, especially in certain ethnic groups, while mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.",Neurodegenerative disease,Amantadine hydrochloride
H00057,D02562,Parkinson disease,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Rasagiline mesylate
H00014,D09733,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Afatinib dimaleate

H01662,D00293,Generalized anxiety disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder is a persistent and common mental disorder. This disorder is twice as common in women than it is in men. The symptoms include generalised and persistent excessive anxiety and a combination of various psychological and somatic complaints, such as threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, tension, palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. The symptoms overlap greatly with those of other mental disorders and we could regard the disorder as part of a spectrum of mood and related disorders rather than an independent disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder has a relapsing course, and intervention rarely results in complete resolution of symptoms. But in the short term and medium term, effective treatments include psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacological treatments, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).",Mental and behavioural disorder,Diazepam
H01637,D08890,Hypertriglyceridemia,"Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a condition with fasting triglyceride (TG) levels in blood continuing to rise. HTG generally refers to an increase of plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations above the 95th percentile for age and gender of a reference population. HTG has generally been classified as primary when a definite familial or inherited basis is suspected, whereas secondary HTG refers to cases where there coexist one or more identifiable secondary conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), alcohol consumption, various medications, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, etc. Genetic conditions with HTG include familial HTG (FHTG), familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) [DS:H00153], and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) [DS:H00156]. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of HTG, fibrates, niacin and n-3 fatty acids. Each of these classes has limitations. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.",Metabolic disease,Choline fenofibrate

Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives. Blood pressure is a heritable trait; an estimated 30% of variance in blood pressure relates to genetic factors.

H01450,D05374,Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Paroxetine hydrochloride
H01608,D02735,Cervical dystonia,"Cervical dystonia (CD), formerly referred to as spasmodic torticollis, is a condition characterized by simultaneous and sustained contractions of both agonist and antagonist muscles of the neck, which frequently result in abnormal movements or postures. CD is considered a form of primary adult-onset focal dystonia. The majority of patients complain of pain, which is not a common feature of other focal dystonias. Head rotation is common, but head tilt, neck extension, and flexionmay also occur, often in combination. The pathogenesis of primary CD is unclear. Patients with secondary CD may have an abnormal birth or developmental history, exposure to drugs known to cause dystonia (tardive dystonia), or neurological illness. Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BoNT), have been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated when used to treat CD, and are therefore recommended as first-line therapy by current treatment guidelines.",Nervous system disease,Rimabotulinumtoxin B
H01672,D00970,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder.

H01641,D00184,Dry eye desease,"Dry eye disease (also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca) is multifactorial disease of the tears, lids, and ocular surface which can result in symptoms of discomfort and/or visual disturbance and/or tear film instability with the potential for damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and subacute inflammation of the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common. Aqueous insufficiency is divided into two main groups: Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye and non-Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye (which includes the use of systemic medication). Dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) [DS:H01502] is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual's last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer's test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye. The benefit of long-term topical anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate or severe dry eye disease with corticosteroids or cyclosporine A eye drops has been documented in clinical trials on a high evidence level.

H01672,D00975,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.",Immune system disease,Dexamethasone sodium phosphate
H01653,D02995,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder.

It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking.

H00014,D11012,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring.

H01645,D02259,Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a pathological disorder characterised by increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland. The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission. In patients with toxic nodular goiter, ATDs are generally used to restore euthyroidism before definitive treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, and infrequently used as long-term treatment when the other two therapies are contraindicated or the patient has a short life expectancy.",Endocrine disease,Sodium iodide I 131

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Calcipotriene

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H00079,D00088,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Hydrocortisone

COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations.

Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

H00083,D05095,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Mycophenolate sodium

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD.

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Esomeprazole magnesium dihydrate

It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear.

H00004,D08956,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

Proximal RTA (type 2) is caused by an impairment of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules. RTA type 3 is a mixed type that shares the features of both proximal and distal lesions. RTA type 4 is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling.",Urinary system disease,Potassium citrate
H01657,D00088,Nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by heavy proteinuria (more than 3.5 grams per day), hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Calcineurin inhibitors with/without intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT) constitute the standard treatment for SRNS. It has been reported that additional rituximab treatment combined with conventional MPT and immunosuppressive agents is a promising option.",Urinary system disease,Hydrocortisone
H01634,D00295,Peptic ulcer,"Peptic ulcer is a common disorder of gastrointestinal system characterized by mucosal damage secondary to pepsin and gastric acid secretion. It usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. Typical symptoms include episodic burning epigastric pain, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy. About 25 percent of patients with peptic ulcer have a serious complication such as hemorrhage, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction. Administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and endoscopic therapy control most bleeds.",Digestive system disease,Cimetidine
H01649,D04820,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Lurasidone hydrochloride
H00083,D00184,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Cyclosporine
H01633,D10277,High blood pressure,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most frequent classic cardiovascular risk factor and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular mortality, the main cause of death worldwide. Hypertension is generally classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives. Blood pressure is a heritable trait; an estimated 30% of variance in blood pressure relates to genetic factors.

H00031,D00573,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Goserelin acetate
H01635,D10292,Hyperlipidemia,"Dyslipidemia is a condition characterized by either an increase or decrease in concentration of lipids in the blood. Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and combined hyperlipidemia refer to elevations involving the major cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (LDL), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL), and both, respectively.",Metabolic disease,Niacin and lovastatin

H01532,D09921,Gout,"Gout is a kind of arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. It is triggered due to precipitation and deposition of inflammatory monosodium urate crystals in synovial and other tissues, accompanied by severe pain. The most common symptom include swelling, tenderness, warmth and redness. Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease.

H00630,D11048,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes.

Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Methylprednisolone acetate
H01714,D10505,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

While the pathogenesis of CTEPH is not entirely understood, the primary pathophysiology appears to be related to an initial thrombotic event followed by both inadequate thrombus resolution and secondary arteriopathy. Several risk factors for development of CTEPH have been found, including the size of the initial PE, splenectomy, chronic inflammatory conditions, and indwelling catheters and cardiac pacemaker leads. There is however an increased incidence of elevated factor VIII levels in CTEPH, and this finding persists after treatment.

H01580,D00018,Vitamin C deficiency,"Scurvy occurs because of reduced intake or absorption of vitamin C, which is characterized by bleeding gums, impaired wound healing, petechiae, perifollicular hemorrhage, anemia, arthralgia and joint effusions, fatigue, depression, and sudden death. It appears to result primarily from the decreased synthesis of collagen, a major protein in the body dependent on vitamin C for its biosynthesis. However, this role of vitamin C does not explain all of the manifestations associated with scurvy. At-risk groups include the poor (because of reduced access to groceries), food faddists, and individuals with purported allergies to multiple fruit and vegetable products. Other at-risk groups include persons with gastrointestinal disease (e.g. colitis), anatomical abnormalities, poor dentition, cancer patients on chemotherapy, patients on hemodialysis, and psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, or anorexia). Alcoholic persons represent one of the largest groups at risk for scurvy because they may have poorly balanced diets and because alcohol decreases the absorption of vitamin C.

Approximately one-half of children have localized tumors that can be cured with surgery alone. These favorable tumors are characterized by near-triploid karyotypes with whole chromosome gains. These tumors rarely have structural rearrangements, and they usually express the TrkA neurotrophin receptor. Patients with these tumors are more likely to be less than 1 year of age. The remaining children have widespread metastatic disease or quite large, aggressive, localized tumors. These unfavorable tumors are characterized by structural changes, including deletions of 1p or 11q, unbalanced gain of 17q and/or amplification of the MYCN protooncogene.

Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease.

H00024,D09701,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Abiraterone acetate

This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

H00014,D10808,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome.

H00042,D06409,Glioma,"Gliomas are the most common of the primary brain tumors and account for more than 40% of all central nervous system neoplasms. Gliomas include tumours that are composed predominantly of astrocytes (astrocytomas), oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogliomas), mixtures of various glial cells (for example,oligoastrocytomas) and ependymal cells (ependymomas). The most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma - glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - is one of the most aggressive human cancers. GBM may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations.

H01450,D00823,Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Fluoxetine hydrochloride

Forty percent of the lesions are associated with complications such as ulceration, bleeding, infection, pain, cardiac failure, airway compromise or eye impairment. Pathogenesis of IH is still shrouded in mystery even though various theories have been postulated to explain its origin. Recent studies provide strong evidence for the conclusion that the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Tumor Endothelial Marker 8 (TEM8) mutations represent risk factor mutations for hemangioma formation.

On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

H00021,D03218,Renal cell carcinoma,"Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha.

Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes.

H01695,D00981,Erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects.

H01656,D04409,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Halobetasol propionate

There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

H00014,D10773,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

H00079,D00246,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Budesonide
H00003,D11390,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis.

The best characterized genes are TP53 (also known as p53) and ATM, for which mutations and/or deletions have been described that predict rapid disease progression, resistance to conventional therapies and poor survival.",Cancer,Ibrutinib
H01431,D10497,Cushing syndrome,"Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare disorder resulting from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids via exogenous and endogenous sources. The typical clinical features of CS are related to hypercortisolism and include accumulation of central fat, moon facies, neuromuscular weakness, osteoporosis or bone fractures, metabolic complications, and mood changes. Traditionally, endogenous CS is classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent (about 80%) or ACTH- independent (about 20%). Among ACTH-dependent forms, pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing's disease) is most common. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic, resulting from monoclonal expansion of a single mutated cell. Recently recurrent activating somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 gene (USP8) were identified in almost half of corticotroph adenoma. Germline mutations in MEN1 (encoding menin), AIP (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein), PRKAR1A (encoding cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit) and CDKN1B (encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; also known as p27 Kip1) have been identified in familial forms of pituitary adenomas. However, the frequency of familial pituitary adenomas is less than 5% in patients with pituitary adenomas. Among ACTH-independent CS, adrenal adenoma is most common. Rare adrenal causes of CS include primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) or primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD).",Endocrine and metabolic disease,Pasireotide diaspartate

Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha.

It is among the most common ocular conditions affecting both children and adults. The etiology is complex and not fully understood, but the general consensus is that bacteria and inflammation contribute to the pathology. Blepharitis can be classified into anterior blepharitis and posterior blepharitis. Anterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the eyelid skin and eyelash follicles and may be accompanied by squamous debris or collarettes. Anterior blepharitis has classically been associated with Staphylococcus infection and seborrheic dermatitis. Posterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the meibomian glands and their orifices and may be a result of or cause of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is one cause of posterior blepharitis but others include infectious or allergic conjunctivitis, and rosacea. The diagnosis of blepharitis is almost always based on the history and clinical examination. Long-term management of symptoms may include daily eyelid cleansing routines and the use of therapeutic agents that reduce infection and inflammation.

There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

About 80% of AMLs are sporadic and not associated with any genetic syndrome. Remaining cases are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The pathogenesis of TSC is thought to result from mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that encode the proteins tuberin and hamartin, respectively. These proteins interact with each other to form heterodimers, whose most important role is inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Loss of inhibition of mTORC1 leads to increased activation of this pathway and the formation of the lesions characteristic of TSC.

As with BCC, risk for development of SCC is strongly influenced by the nature and dose of UV radiation and genetic backgrounds that regulate that interaction. Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%. As with TP53, UV-induced mutations in HRAS and KRAS have also been characterized in both actinic keratoses and SCC. The reported frequency of RAS mutations in SCCs ranges from approximately 10% to almost 50%. Several recent studies have also reported mutations of p16 in up to 24% of SCCs.

The laryngeal angioedema is potentially lethal. The classic forms, HAE types I and II, result from deficiency of the plasma protease inhibitor, C1 inhibitor (C1INH). Type I HAE is caused by decreased expression of C1INH in the plasma whereas type 2 HAE, consisting approximately 15% of patients with HAE, is due to expression of a dysfunctional C1INH protein. HAE type III has been observed exclusively in women and appears to be correlated with high estrogen levels.",Vascular disease,Lanadelumab
H00031,D01068,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Vinblastine sulfate
H01730,D09017,Myocardial infarction,"Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a term for an event of heart attack. It is due to formation of plaques in the interior walls of the arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the heart and injuring heart muscles because of lack of oxygen supply. The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, nausea, epigastric discomfort, syncope, diaphoresis, and other factors. The diagnosis of MI is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical criteria, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, imaging studies and biomarkers used to detect death of cardiomyocytes. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack.

H00024,D07866,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Docetaxel
H01714,D02981,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Arformoterol tartrate

H01656,D00129,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies.

H01649,D08035,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Haloperidol lactate
H00083,D03058,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Basiliximab

H00022,D10574,Bladder cancer,"The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).",Cancer,Pembrolizumab

There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

H00019,D04197,Pancreatic cancer,"Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes.

Progressive thyrocyte depletion results in impaired thyroid hormone production and clinical hypothyroidism, a condition that involves a marked reduction of metabolic activity in various cells and tissues. AITDs are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.",Immune system disease,Thyroid

The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

H00024,D01413,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Estradiol valerate
H01694,D00981,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes. There is still no consensus on a definite treatment method for SJS-TEN.

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible.

H01456,D00357,Diabetic nephropathy,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN), also called diabetic kidney disease, is a microvascular complication of diabetes which induces dysfunction in various cell types of the kidney, ultimately leading to the renal failure. A clinical syndrome of DN is characterized by decreased Glomerular Filteration Rate (GFR), excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, thickening of the peripheral glomerular basement membrane, glomerular hypertrophy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, increased excretion of albumin and decreased creatinine clearance. Generally, DN is divided into five stages: (i) hyperfunction with raised GFR and increased kidney volume; (ii) normalbuminuria with the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and the expansion of the mesangial matrix; (iii) incipient DN with MAU (30-299 mg per day); (iv) overt DN with macroalbuminuria (>300 mg per day); (v) uremia with end-stage renal disease.

H00079,D00371,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Theophylline

H01698,D00751,Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic and polygenic immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology. It is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals over the age of 50 in Western countries. It is characterized by inflammatory damage of the aorta and/or aortic branches, particularly the temporal artery, which can lead to severe complications such as blindness or cerebrovascular disorders. GCA is twice as common in women. It is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Laboratory tests usually reveal high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase proteins, anemia of chronic disease, and thrombocytosis. Genetic association studies have described several genes that are associated with predisposition to GCA, including genes of immune-inflammatory pathways and genes of the HLA class I and II regions. The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles seem to be the most consistently associated genetic risk factors for GCA. Outside the HLA region, the most significant loci included PTPN22. Glucocorticoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for GCA but are associated with frequent adverse events. Tocilizumab, a humanised antihuman IL-6 receptor antibody, has been used successfully in several reports as a treatment of GCA.",Immune system disease; Cardiovascular disease; Nervous system disease,Methylprednisolone sodium succinate
H01654,D00979,Lichen planus,"Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory and immune mediated skin disease with characteristic clinical and histopathologic features. The skin and oral mucosa are the most frequently involved areas. Other mucous membranes (including the genitalia, esophagus, and conjunctiva) and skin appendages (e.g., scalp hair and nails) can also be affected. The etiology and pathogenesis of LP remain unclear. An autoimmune reaction in which CD8+-T lymphocytes attack basal keratinocytes leading to apoptosis of the cells has been favored. Various potential triggers, e.g. viral or bacterial antigens, metal ions, drugs or physical factors, could initiate the autoimmune process. Nonetheless, the role of the individual trigger factors is controversial. There is a significant association between lichen planus and infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The diagnosis of LP is based on the clinical presentation and should be confirmed by biopsy, if suspected. Histopathology is often conclusive, but in vesiculobullous cutaneous LP or erosive oral LP, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies can be an integral step in differentiating between LP and other diseases. With few exceptions, all forms of LP are treated with the same measures.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis.

Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear.

The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed.

It is now understood that ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma are the same disease entities at the morphologic and immunophenotypic levels and classified as either B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL and T-ALL). In the case of B-ALL, numerous reports have demonstrated that recurring genetic abnormalities are associated with sufficiently unique clinical, immunophenotypic, and/or prognostic features so that they can be considered as distinct entities. The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) 'Philadelphia' chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners.

Originally limited to the hospital setting, MRSA is a growing cause of infections in the community. Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains are genetically different from MRSA strains originating in the hospital. Its increase in the community is of concern because CA-MRSA strains appear to be highly virulent, and colonization with CA-MRSA is often undetected in hospitalized patients, which can facilitate its potential for becoming resistant to multiple antibiotics. Health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) is usually associated with pneumonia, urinary tract, blood stream, and surgical wound infections.

H00057,D00780,Parkinson disease,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.",Neurodegenerative disease,Bromocriptine mesylate
H00024,D00989,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Leuprolide acetate

HTG generally refers to an increase of plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations above the 95th percentile for age and gender of a reference population. HTG has generally been classified as primary when a definite familial or inherited basis is suspected, whereas secondary HTG refers to cases where there coexist one or more identifiable secondary conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), alcohol consumption, various medications, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, etc. Genetic conditions with HTG include familial HTG (FHTG), familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) [DS:H00153], and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) [DS:H00156]. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of HTG, fibrates, niacin and n-3 fatty acids. Each of these classes has limitations.

WM can be distinguished clinically from LPL on the basis of a detectable monoclonal (IgM) immunoglobulin spike in serum. In the general population, LPL/WM is a very rare disease, accounting for only 1%-2% of all hematologic malignancies, reflected in an incidence rate of 3-4 cases per million people per year. The t(9;14)(p13;q32) is present in near 50% of cases of LPL. This chromosomal translocation involves a junction between 9p13 and the switch micro region of the Ig heavy chain locus on 14q32. The 9p13 breakpoint contains the PAX-5 gene which encodes a B-cell specific transcription factor involved in the control of B-cell proliferation and differentiation. The translocation causes the juxtaposition of the PAX-5 gene to the IgH locus in the opposite direction of transcription, resulting in an 11-fold over-expression of PAX-5 mRNA.",Cancer,Ibrutinib
H00079,D00690,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Mometasone furoate

Patients with TSC are frequently diagnosed with comorbid neurological disorders, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, behavioral dysregulation, sleep disorders, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). TSC most often results from spontaneous genetic mutations in one or two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These gene products form a physical and functional complex to limit activation of the mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1. When these genes are deficient, mTOR complex 1 is constitutively up-regulated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and protein synthesis.",Congenital malformation,Cannabidiol

Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear.

H01653,D00789,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Chlorpromazine hydrochloride

Moreover, AIHAs are classified in primary (idiopathic), in which hemolysis dominates the clinical picture in the absence of any other coexisting disorder, and in secondary forms, accompanying and complicating an underlying disease. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia.

The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, nausea, epigastric discomfort, syncope, diaphoresis, and other factors. The diagnosis of MI is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical criteria, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, imaging studies and biomarkers used to detect death of cardiomyocytes. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack.

The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

Approximately 200000 cases of SCC develop per year, causing about 2000 deaths. Unlike BCCs, which have no known precursor lesions, SCCs can emerge from actinic keratoses. As with BCC, risk for development of SCC is strongly influenced by the nature and dose of UV radiation and genetic backgrounds that regulate that interaction. Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%. As with TP53, UV-induced mutations in HRAS and KRAS have also been characterized in both actinic keratoses and SCC. The reported frequency of RAS mutations in SCCs ranges from approximately 10% to almost 50%. Several recent studies have also reported mutations of p16 in up to 24% of SCCs.

H01694,D00088,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,"Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes.

H01649,D01164,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Aripiprazole

In the case of B-ALL, numerous reports have demonstrated that recurring genetic abnormalities are associated with sufficiently unique clinical, immunophenotypic, and/or prognostic features so that they can be considered as distinct entities. The most common rearrangements observed in B-ALL are the t(12;21) (p13;q22) rearrangement resulting in expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (TEL-AML1); the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation that results in expression of the TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner, (also known as TCF3) TFPT-PBX1 fusion (E2A-PBX); the t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) 'Philadelphia' chromosome resulting in expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion; and rearrangements of MLL (also known as KMT2A) at 11q23 to a diverse array of fusion partners.

There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

H00014,D06503,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear.

Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons.

The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

This mutation results in a gain of function, i.e., in the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which plays an important role in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the hemopoietic cells, as well as in the immune function. Besides, a minority of patients with MF (most of them negative for the JAK2 mutation) harbor other JAK-STAT-activating mutation, the MPL mutation, in the gene of the receptor of the thrombopoietin. Recently, mutations in the CALR gene have been described in 86% of cases with primary MF that are negative for JAK2 or MPL mutations. CALR mutation also showed cytokine independent growth of cells due to activation of STAT5 involved with the JAK-STAT pathway but its exact role in MPN remains to be clarified.",Cancer,Oxymetholone

Several systemic and extraglandular manifestations can develop, including fatigue, arthritis, and involvement of organs such as the skin, lungs, and kidneys. SS may occur as a primary disorder or in association with other systemic autoimmune diseases, traditionally defined as secondary SS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Salivary secretions from these patients exhibit elevated levels of antibodies and cytokines. This is accompanied by a reduction in oral phosphate levels and xerostomia due to reduced salivary flow, which can lead to infections, progressive caries, dysphagia and oral pain. Current tests for SS include sialometry, salivary scintigraphy, sialography, serological tests or minor salivary gland biopsies. Recently, salivary biomarkers of SS has been investigated. The etiology of SS is still unclear. Since there is a familial aggregation of primary SS, however, genetic factors have been suspected for a long time. Initially, HLA haplotypes were shown to be associated with primary SS.

H00031,D00963,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

H01621,D00106,Pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

H01698,D02596,Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic and polygenic immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology. It is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals over the age of 50 in Western countries. It is characterized by inflammatory damage of the aorta and/or aortic branches, particularly the temporal artery, which can lead to severe complications such as blindness or cerebrovascular disorders. GCA is twice as common in women. It is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Laboratory tests usually reveal high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase proteins, anemia of chronic disease, and thrombocytosis. Genetic association studies have described several genes that are associated with predisposition to GCA, including genes of immune-inflammatory pathways and genes of the HLA class I and II regions. The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles seem to be the most consistently associated genetic risk factors for GCA. Outside the HLA region, the most significant loci included PTPN22. Glucocorticoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for GCA but are associated with frequent adverse events.

Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene.

Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects.",Cancer,Paclitaxel
H01602,D00318,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which reflux of the stomach contents into the oesophagus results in symptoms or, occasionally, complications. GERD can be classified as non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or erosive reflux disease (ERD) based on the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal damage seen on endoscopy. ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Famotidine

Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

H01653,D09876,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Cariprazine hydrochloride

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy.

Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons. Its prevalence is 1% to 3% in the general population and 34% to 83% in immunocompromised persons.

Fallopian tube cancers are similar to ovarian cancer with respect to the proportion of tumors with abnormal expression of c-erbB-2 and p53. It has been proposed that the p53 signature is the earliest step in the pathogenesis of fallopian tube cancer. In this model, tubal epithelium on the fimbria experiences genotoxic damage and, as a result, the secretory cell exhibits over-accumulation of p53 protein (p53 signature).

Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression.",Cancer,Pomalidomide
H01646,D00822,Major depressive disorder,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric disorder mainly characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, and a high risk of suicide. Accumulated evidence suggests that both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the etiology of MDD although the pathogenesis of MDD remains unknown. Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Recently, selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs,) have become the first-line antidepressant drug treatment of depression and replaced tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to fewer side-effects and ease of use.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Citalopram hydrobromide
H00020,D05350,Colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).",Cancer,Panitumumab
H01483,D10566,Acromegaly,"Acromegaly (ACM) is a disorder characterized by increased circulating GH and IGF-I (a GH-induced liver protein) levels that is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality. Patients with persistently elevated GH and IGF-I levels have an increased risk of multiple comorbidities, including left ventricular dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, arthritis, impaired glucose tolerance, and colonic polyps. Most cases of ACM occur as a result of a sporadic GH-secreting pituitary adenoma (PA). However, ACM can occur in a familial setting, either associated with other endocrine abnormalities or as an isolated disorder. Somatic activating mutations in the GNAS gene, which encodes for the Gs-alpha subunit of G-proteins, are found in up to 40% of sporadic GH-secreting PA. Familial ACM can occur in the context of rare inherited syndromes such as familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), which is caused in 15-20% of cases by aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene germline mutations.

Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia.

EAA is caused by a wide variety of antigens including bacteria, organic materials, fungal spores, and chemicals. Of the various EAA syndromes, Farmer's lung and Bird fancier's disease are the commonest forms that have been studied. EEA is a complex dynamic clinical syndrome where clinical expression depends on the frequency and amount of contact with antigen and host susceptibility.

H00014,D11712,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.

Pain usually occurs two to five hours after meals or on an empty stomach. The most common causes of peptic ulcer are Helicobacter pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking increases the risk of ulcer recurrence and slows healing. Most patients are treated successfully with eradication of H. pylori and/or avoidance of NSAIDs, along with the appropriate use of antisecretory therapy.

H00024,D00965,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Nilutamide

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy.

According to Lauren's histological classification gastric cancer is divided into two distinct histological groups - the intestinal and diffuse types. Several genetic changes have been identified in intestinal-type GC. The intestinal metaplasia is characterized by mutations in p53 gene, reduced expression of retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR-beta) and hTERT expression. Gastric adenomas furthermore display mutations in the APC gene, reduced p27 expression and cyclin E amplification. In addition, amplification and overexpression of c-ErbB2, reduced TGF-beta receptor type I (TGFBRI) expression and complete loss of p27 expression are commonly observed in more advanced GC.

COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations.

The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed.

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).",Digestive system disease,Esomeprazole strontium

H01674,D00146,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression. The most frequently applied biological agents approved for AS are TNF alpha inhibitors.

H01604,D00983,Polymyositis and dermatomyositis,"Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.",Musculoskeletal disease,Triamcinolone acetonide

It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

H00024,D00586,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators.

Accumulated evidence suggests that both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the etiology of MDD although the pathogenesis of MDD remains unknown. Mutations in genes involved in brain serotonin synthesis, have been identified in patients. Brain serotonin deficiency has been hypothesized to play a role in a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including MDD. Several efficacious treatments for MDD are available, including different forms of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Recently, selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs,) have become the first-line antidepressant drug treatment of depression and replaced tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to fewer side-effects and ease of use.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Selegiline
H01895,D11624,Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder first diagnosed in childhood and frequently persistent throughout adult life. The disorder is classically characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Many children with ADHD go on to have problems related to education, social functioning, and/or other mental illness as adolescents and young adults. Although heritability estimates are consistently high, ADHD is a genetically complex disorder characterized by multifactorial inheritance involving numerous genes of moderate effect. Reports implicate variants of genes important for the synthesis, uptake, transport and receptor binding of dopamine in the etiology of ADHD. And interaction between the dopamine and serotonin systems has been implicated in both the pathophysiology of ADHD and the mechanism of action of widely used stimulant compounds.",Mental and behavioural disorder,"Amphetamine aspartate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate and dextroamphetamine sulfate"
H00031,D10733,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Talazoparib tosylate
H00010,D11595,Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression.",Cancer,Belantamab mafodotin
H01714,D10256,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a representative chronic inflammatory disorder of the lungs that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.",Lung disease,Albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide
H01717,D00472,Optic neuritis,"Optic neuritis is a demyelinating inflammatory disease of the optic nerve that presents with an abrupt loss of vision. The majority of patients are between the ages of 20 and 50 years, with a mean age ranging from 30 to 35 years. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. The onset is usually with pain on eye movement in one eye and subacute visual loss. One-third of patients have a mildly edematous optic disc. The visual disturbance resolves in 95% of cases. Many cases of optic neuritis are associated with multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica or can occur in isolation. Occasionally, optic neuritis can result from infectious processes involving the paranasal sinuses or occur in the course of a systemic viral infection. High-dosed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy speeds recovery but does not improve the final outcome. For patients judged to be at high risk of developing multiple sclerosis, immune prophylaxis with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate is recommended.",Nervous system disease,Prednisolone
H00630,D03203,Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA.",Autoimmune disease,Abatacept

'Angina' is used to describe clinical symptoms such as discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arms that are induced by physical exertion or emotional stress and subside with rest or treatment with nitroglycerin. Angina is clinically classified into stable angina (SA) and unstable angina (UA). SA is a chronic medical condition while UA is an acute coronary syndrome. Among the causes of angina pectoris, the most common is coronary artery disease (CAD). At the cellular level, angina pectoris is a result of increased myocardial oxygen demand or decreased myocardial oxygen supply.",Cardiovascular disease,Nadolol
H01532,D00973,Gout,"Gout is a kind of arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. It is triggered due to precipitation and deposition of inflammatory monosodium urate crystals in synovial and other tissues, accompanied by severe pain. The most common symptom include swelling, tenderness, warmth and redness. Mostly, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected, gout progresses with more frequent attacks that involve multiple joints. Joint pain that used to resolve in a week to 10 days could become a milder, but constant pain. Eventually, untreated gout can cause other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of the disease is more common in 40s men than women, but gout in women after menopause appears increased risk. Recently, the onset in 20s increases. The development of gout is not only associated with sex, age, race and genetics, but also diet and lifestyle are contributed to increasing prevalence of the disease.

The symptoms include generalised and persistent excessive anxiety and a combination of various psychological and somatic complaints, such as threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, tension, palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. The symptoms overlap greatly with those of other mental disorders and we could regard the disorder as part of a spectrum of mood and related disorders rather than an independent disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder has a relapsing course, and intervention rarely results in complete resolution of symptoms. But in the short term and medium term, effective treatments include psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacological treatments, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).",Mental and behavioural disorder,Alprazolam
H00020,D10526,Colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).",Cancer,Trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride

H00043,D01275,Neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is a tumor derived from primitive cells of the sympathetic nervous system and is the most common solid tumor in childhood. Approximately one-half of children have localized tumors that can be cured with surgery alone. These favorable tumors are characterized by near-triploid karyotypes with whole chromosome gains. These tumors rarely have structural rearrangements, and they usually express the TrkA neurotrophin receptor. Patients with these tumors are more likely to be less than 1 year of age. The remaining children have widespread metastatic disease or quite large, aggressive, localized tumors. These unfavorable tumors are characterized by structural changes, including deletions of 1p or 11q, unbalanced gain of 17q and/or amplification of the MYCN protooncogene. They might also express the TrkB neurotrophin receptor and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

H01563,D07133,HIV infection,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.",Infectious disease,Raltegravir potassium
H00007,D10316,Hodgkin lymphoma,"Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).",Cancer,Nivolumab

H01649,D01898,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Haloperidol decanoate
H01585,D00983,Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a relatively uncommon disorder caused by the increased destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) by anti-RBC autoantibodies with or without complement activation. AIHAs can be distinguished on the basis of the autoantibody Ig class and thermal characteristics, i.e. the optimal temperature of reaction with autologous erythrocytes, in warm (wAIHA), cold (cold agglutinin disease; CAD), and mixed forms, although atypical cases of difficult diagnostic classification are reported with increasing frequency. Moreover, AIHAs are classified in primary (idiopathic), in which hemolysis dominates the clinical picture in the absence of any other coexisting disorder, and in secondary forms, accompanying and complicating an underlying disease. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia. The diagnosis is usually simple, based on the presence of hemolytic anemia and serological evidence of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, detectable by the direct antiglobulin test (DAT).",Hematologic disease; Immune system disease,Triamcinolone acetonide
H01695,D00407,Erythema multiforme,"Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects.

H00024,D06644,Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.",Cancer,Sipuleucel-T

JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome.

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

Fallopian tube cancers are similar to ovarian cancer with respect to the proportion of tumors with abnormal expression of c-erbB-2 and p53. It has been proposed that the p53 signature is the earliest step in the pathogenesis of fallopian tube cancer. In this model, tubal epithelium on the fimbria experiences genotoxic damage and, as a result, the secretory cell exhibits over-accumulation of p53 protein (p53 signature).

Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5.

In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.",Cancer,Sacituzumab govitecan

H00014,D10891,Non-small cell lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.",Cancer,Capmatinib hydrochloride

H01656,D02597,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.",Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease,Adalimumab

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

H01593,D11570,Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a generalised reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and an increased risk of fracture. Since BMD values fall progressively with age, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of all women will have osteoporosis by the age of 80. Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common diagnosis in this disease, suggesting that a monocausal etiology has not been identified. However, a number of risk factors associated with EH have also been identified such as age, sex, demographic, environmental, genetic, and vascular factors. Secondary hypertension generally has an earlier age at onset, no family history, and a clear cause such as a renal or endocrine disorder, or an iatrogenic trigger, such as use of oral contraceptives.

H01653,D02340,Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.",Mental and behavioural disorder,Loxapine

H00015,D06503,Malignant pleural mesothelioma,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but very aggressive tumor that arises from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial cavities. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common type, accounting for about 70% of all MM cases. Past asbestos exposure represents the major risk factor for MPM, as the link between asbestos fibres and MPM has been largely proved by epidemiological and experimental studies. Recently, simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated in the aetiology of MPM. The accumulation of numerous clonal chromosomal deletions in most MMs suggests a multistep process of tumorigenesis, characterized by the loss and/or inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of MMs have demonstrated frequent deletions of specific sites within chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 6q, 9p, 13q, 15q, and 22q. Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. Mutations of the p53 gene (TP53) are occasionally observed in MMs.",Cancer,Pemetrexed sodium hydrate
H00079,D00685,Asthma,"Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.",Immune system disease,Metaproterenol sulfate

H01674,D00472,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression.

H00083,D00107,Allograft rejection,"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.",Immune system disease,Tacrolimus
